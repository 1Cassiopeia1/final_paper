 IT HAD TO BE ABOUT TIME FOR THE DEALERS TO CHANGE SHIFTS, AND HE LIKED TO SUPERVISE THEM HIMSELF.
 WITH UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND TURNS, AND PLENTY OF ACTION AND ROMANCE, THIS IS A PACY AND EXCITING ADVENTURE, BUT ALSO A MULTI-LAYERED STORY OF SELFDISCOVERY, WITH AN INTELLIGENT AND COMPELLING HEROINE IN ALINA.
 AROUND HER, MASKED AND VEILED MEN AND WOMEN CROWDED ONTO THE TERRACED LEDGES, STAMPING THEIR FEET AS THE ACTION PROCEEDED BELOW.
 THEN THE ENTIRE ROTUNDA SEEMED TO EXPLODE INTO ACTION AS GUARDS RUSHED TO THEIR POSTS AND COMMANDERS BEGAN CALLING ORDERS.
” DOUGHTY GRUNTED AGREEMENT, SURVEYING THE ACTION TAKING PLACE AT THE TABLES BELOW – DICE, CARDS, MAKKER ’S WHEEL, FORTUNES WON AND LOST, AND A DELICIOUS SLICE OF ALL OF IT CAME TO ROLLINS.
 HE’D NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN ANYA HEAL SOMEONE.
 YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE HAD TO UNCURL THAT LIP AND TREAT ME WITH SOMETHING CLOSER TO RESPECT.
 IT WAS A CONTRACT THAT SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY PAY OFF IN A YEAR OR TWO IF SHE WAS SMART WITH HER MONEY.
” KNOCK HIM OUT, BUT DON’T ACTUALLY HURT HIM.
 “IF YOU’VE ACTUALLY LOST YOUR MIND, THIS IS GOING TO BE A LOT TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT,” SAID THAT RASPY VOICE.
 “IT’S THE ONE DAY A YEAR THEY ALL STOP ACTING SO MISERABLE AND ACTUALLY LET THEMSELVES HAVE A GOOD TIME,” NINA REPLIED.
 KAZ WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED HIM.
 WYLAN VAN ECK WAS ACTUALLY CURLED UP ON THE DOCK, HIS SOFT MERCHER ’S HANDS THROWN OVER HIS HEAD.
 “WE’RE ACTUALLY DOING THIS.
 IT WASN’T PRETTY, THOUGH THEY WERE SO TIGHTLY PACKED TOGETHER IT DIDN’T LOOK LIKE ANYONE COULD ACTUALLY FALL AND CHOKE.
 MATTHIAS HAD DESCRIBED THE LAYOUT OF THE ICE COURT IN DETAIL, BUT HE’D SAID LITTLE ABOUT THE WAY IT ACTUALLY LOOKED.
 BUT IF JESPER WAS ANXIOUS, WYLAN LOOKED AS IF HE MIGHT ACTUALLY THROW UP.
 FLIRTING WITH HIM MIGHT ACTUALLY BE MORE FUN THAN ANNOYING HIM, BUT IT WAS A CLOSE CALL.
 JESPER WASN’T SURE HOW MUCH WYLAN WAS ACTUALLY HELPING, BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY WORKING HARD.
 BUT NINA REMEMBERED WHAT MATTHIAS HAD SAID: AS YOU MOVED DEEPER INTO THE RINGS, SECURITY ACTUALLY TIGHTENED – IT JUST BECAME LESS VISIBLE.
 “SAYING THAT DOESN’T ACTUALLY MAKE ME WORK FASTER,” JESPER COMPLAINED AS HE CONCENTRATED ON THE STONES.
 “SAINTS, KAZ, YOU ACTUALLY LOOK HAPPY.
 THIS BASICALLY TRANSLATES TO ‘BONE DEATH’, WHICH SOUNDS KIND OF GOTHY AND ROMANTIC, BUT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT EVERY STEP I TAKE IS PAINFUL AND THAT I SOMETIMES NEED TO WALK WITH A CANE.
) RICHARD WHEELER ADVISED ME ON HOW GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AND HIGH-SECURITY FACILITIES ACTUALLY KEEP OUT NE’ERDO-WELLS.
 “WE SHOULD STILL TAKE RASKE AND LEAVE THIS BABY MERCH ON LOCKDOWN IN KETTERDAM.
 MY MOTHER, MY FATHER, MY BABY SISTER.
 WHEN THE SOUNDS HAD FADED, KAZ SIGNALLED TO HER, AND THEY SLIPPED BACK OUT THE DOOR, CLOSING IT AS SILENTLY AS POSSIBLE BEHIND THEM, AND CONTINUED THEIR ASCENT.
 HE’D ASSUMED THEY’D CROSS THE ARENA AND HEAD BACK UP INTO THE STANDS TO AVOID THE CROWDS CLOGGING THE PASSAGEWAY, POSSIBLY JUST STORM THE STAIRS AND HOPE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE GUARDS WHO MUST BE WAITING AT THE TOP.
 “RASKE IS THE BETTER DEMO MAN—” INEJ BEGAN.
 “I THOUGHT HE DID DEMO WORK.
 JESPER HAD EXPECTED THE REST OF THE CREW TO BE COLLECTING DEMO SUPPLIES IN THE BIG LAUNDRY ROOM ALREADY.
 “WELL, DEMO IS OUT,” HE SAID.
 WE HAVE NO WEAPONS AND NO DEMO MATERIALS.
 HE HAD SURVIVED THE FEVER, BUT HE MIGHT WELL DIE OUT HERE ON THE REAPER ’S BARGE.
 HE HESITATED THEN SAID, “YOU MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER, EASE HIS WOE AND ALL THAT … BUT COULD YOU COMPEL HIM TO DO SOMETHING?
 HE PUSHED AHEAD, FEELING ALMOST AT PEACE, AS IF HERE DJEL COULD HEAR HIM AND EASE HIS TROUBLED MIND.
 HE SHOULDN’T LET HER DO THIS, SHOULDN’T SHOW HIS WEAKNESS, BUT AS HIS BLOOD BEGAN TO FLOW AND HIS BODY WARMED, THE RELIEF AND EASE THAT COURSED THROUGH HIM FELT TOO GOOD TO RESIST.
 SHE LOOKED ILL AT EASE WITH THE GUN.
 GHEZEN SHOWS HIS FAVOUR TO THOSE WHO ARE DESERVING, TO THOSE WHO BUILD CITIES, NOT THE RATS WHO EAT AWAY AT THEIR FOUNDATIONS.
 JESPER AND MATTHIAS OPENED FIRE, BUT THEY HAD TO FACE THE SUN TO SHOOT AND NOT EVEN JESPER COULD AIM BLIND.
 THE RULES OF FAIR PLAY AMONG THE GANGS WERE FROM PER HASKELL’S TIME.
 “IT’S NOT FAIR FOR YOU TO CULL EVERY SPEND-HAPPY TOURIST STEPPING OFF A PLEASURE BOAT AT FIFTH HARBOUR.
 GRISHA ARE GIVEN A FAIR TRIAL—” SHE TURNED ON HIM, GOGGLES UP, TEARS FROZEN ON HER CHEEKS.
 SO IS THE SECOND ARMY, AND WHEN THEY DO, I HOPE THEY GIVE YOU THE FAIR TRIAL YOU DESERVE.
 “THAT MEANS HE’S GOING TO GO STICK HIS HEAD IN THE GRISHA WORKSHOP TO GET A LOOK AT HIS GIRL.
 EVEN IF HE’D HAD THE COURAGE TO GET INTO A FIGHT WITH A SQUALLER, IT WOULD BE LIKE BRAWLING WITH AN EXPENSIVE VASE.
 THEY COULDN’T GET INSIDE YOUR HEAD.
 “HE’S GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED,” SHE SAID.
 “STATISTICALLY, HE’LL PROBABLY ONLY GET SOME OF US KILLED.
 “THE DREGS GET FIRST CRACK AT THE PIGEONS WHO COME LOOKING FOR A LITTLE FUN.
 I HAD TO PAY THROUGH THE GILLS TO GET THAT ROSTER.
 MAYBE YOUR GUARDS GET ME OR MY GUYS, BUT NO WAY YOU’RE GOING TO DODGE THIS BULLET.
 DO WE GET TO GO HOME TONIGHT?
 “YOU’LL GET WHAT’S COMING TO YOU SOME DAY, BREKKER.
 “OR MAYBE YOU CAN GET THE LOVELY ELISE TO DO IT FOR YOU.
 ASSUMING YOU DON’T BLEED TO DEATH TONIGHT, YOU HAVE UNTIL SUNSET TOMORROW TO GET OUT OF KETTERDAM.
” “I HEARD ABOUT A GUY IN SLOKEN WHO LIKED TO ROLL AROUND IN APPLE SYRUP AND THEN GET TWO—” “I’M NOT TALKING,” SAID KAZ.
 THEY’D TELL WHAT THEY’D SEEN, EMBROIDER THE REST, AND WITH EVERY RETELLING, DIRTYHANDS WOULD GET CRAZIER AND MORE RUTHLESS.
 BUT THEY’D NEVER GET IT FROM KAZ, AND IF THEY DIDN’T LIKE IT, THEY COULD FIND ANOTHER CREW TO RUN WITH.
 NOW THEY HAD THEIR OWN TERRITORY, THEIR OWN GAMBLING HALL, AND THAT RUNDOWN HOUSE HAD BECOME THE SLAT, A DRY, WARM PLACE TO GET A HOT MEAL OR HOLE UP WHEN YOU WERE WOUNDED.
” “IF GEELS DOESN’T GET THERE IN TIME—” “NO ONE’S SETTING FIRES AT NINETEEN BURSTRAAT.
 “HOW DID YOU KNOW I WOULD GET TO VAN DAAL IN TIME?
 YOU NEVER GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.
” “HOW DO YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION, MISTER BREKKER?
 “TELL ME HOW TO GET TO THE DOOR OR I’M TAKING YOU THROUGH THE WINDOW WITH ME.
 GET TALKING, VAN ECK.
 THERE’S NO WAY THEY’D LET KNOWLEDGE OF THIS DRUG GET OUT.
” “YOU HAVEN’T BEEN ARRESTED SINCE YOU WERE FOURTEEN, AND SINCE I KNOW YOU ARE NOT AN HONEST MAN ANY MORE THAN YOU WERE AN HONEST BOY, I CAN ONLY ASSUME YOU HAVE THE QUALITY I MOST NEED IN A CRIMINAL: YOU DON’T GET CAUGHT.
 WE THINK SHE DROWNED TRYING TO GET BACK INTO THE CITY.
 IF I FAIL, I DON’T GET PAID.
 “PICK ONE,” KAZ SAID AS HE VANISHED INTO THE NIGHT, THOUGHTS ALREADY TURNING TO THIRTY MILLION KRUGE AND THE CREW HE’D NEED TO HELP HIM GET IT.
 YOU CAN GET A JOB IN ALMOST ANY DEN.
 BUT YOU’LL GET YOUR TWENTY PER CENT.
 AT FIRST THEY’D BEEN SKEPTICAL, SURE IT WAS SOME KIND OF SWINDLE, BUT HE’D BROUGHT THEM IN WITH TINY STAKES AND MANAGED TO GATHER ENOUGH CAPITAL TO PURCHASE THE DILAPIDATED OLD BUILDING, SPRUCE IT UP, AND GET IT RUNNING.
 JUST CAME UP THE STAVE TO GET A BEER AND MEET A FRIEND.
” “A MAN DOESN’T NEED A BED TO GET IDEAS, NINA.
 IF I’M HIS SOLUTION, HE’LL NEVER REALLY GET OVER HER DEATH.
 HOW MANY BRIBES I’D HAVE HAD TO PAY OUT TO GET MATTHIAS HELVAR OUT OF PRISON?
 “EVEN IF YOU COULD GET TO HIM, MATTHIAS WOULD NEVER AGREE TO HELP YOU.
 “SHARKS GET MEAN THERE,” HE’D CLAIMED.
 “HOW DID YOU EVEN GET HERE?
 “IF IT’S THIS EASY TO GET INTO HELLGATE—” “THE PROBLEM ISN’T GETTING IN, IT’S GETTING OUT.
 “YOU DON’T GET IT.
 BUT MATTHIAS STOOD SILENT, UNMOVING, EVEN WHEN THE GATE OPENED, EVEN WHEN THE WOLVES CHARGED OUT OF THE TUNNEL – THREE OF THEM SNARLING AND SNAPPING, TUMBLING OVER ONE ANOTHER TO GET TO HIM.
 “AND WHERE DID YOU GET THAT UNIFORM?
 THEY WERE COMMON AMONG CROOKS IN THE BARREL WHO DIDN’T WANT TO GET CAUGHT IN A DARK ALLEY, BUT COULDN’T BE BOTHERED TO LUG AROUND LANTERNS.
 GET IT?
” “YES, AND DO IT QUICKLY, NINA, BECAUSE IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES, THINGS ARE GOING TO GET VERY HECTIC AROUND HERE.
 WE JUST NEED TO GET HIM THROUGH DIAGNOSIS.
 “GOOD ENOUGH TO GET LOCKED UP IN HELLGATE?
 HEAL HIM FAST AND ONLY ENOUGH TO GET HIM WALKING FOR NOW.
 WE’RE HERE TO GET YOU OUT.
” MATTHIAS SAT FORWARD, TRYING TO GET HIS BEARINGS, CLUTCHING HIS DEAD ARM.
 COSTUMED MEN AND WOMEN SURGED PAST, SCREAMING AND PUSHING EACH OTHER, TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE ARENA.
 “BOYS LIKE YOU WEREN’T MEANT TO GET IDEAS, HELVAR,” SAID KAZ.
 “ANOTHER TEAM COULD GET TO YUL-BAYUR FIRST.
 THAT SHOULD AT LEAST GET YOU PAST THE FIRST CHECKPOINT.
 IF THE DEMON BREKKER SPOKE THE TRUTH, MATTHIAS WOULD GET TO GO HOME.
” “YOU STILL GET YOUR PARDON.
 YOU’LL HAVE TO GET THROUGH A GUARDED CHECKPOINT BEFORE YOU EVEN REACH THE RINGWALL.
 WE DON’T GET INSIDE, YOU DON’T GET YOUR PARDON.
” “AT THE PRISON, THEY WON’T CARE ABOUT WHO’S COMING IN, JUST ANYONE TRYING TO GET OUT.
 “AT THE EMBASSY THEY WON’T CARE WHO’S GOING OUT, THEY’LL JUST BE FOCUSED ON WHO’S TRYING TO GET IN.
” “LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,” SAID JESPER.
 “VAN ECK SAID THE COUNCIL GAVE YUL-BAYUR A CODE WORD WHEN THEY FIRST TRIED TO GET HIM OUT OF SHU HAN SO HE’D KNOW WHO TO TRUST: SESH-UYEH.
 “I’LL NEED YOU TO GET COLD WEATHER GEAR,” HE TOLD HER.
 YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE YOU WANT TO GO BEFORE YOU GET THERE.
 SHE KNEW SHE SHOULD GET USED TO CARRYING A PISTOL, BUT THE WEIGHT THREW OFF HER BALANCE, AND GUNS COULD JAM OR LOCK IN A BAD MOMENT.
 GET MOVING.
 “JUST STAY BEHIND ME AND TRY NOT TO GET KILLED.
 JESPER HATED IT, BUT HE COULDN’T ARGUE WITH THE FACT THAT THEY STILL HAD A WAY TO GET TO FJERDA.
 “I NEED TO GET TO HIGH GROUND.
 NOW, SHE NEEDED TO GET TO THE SCHOONER.
 NEED TO GET YOU PATCHED UP.
 THERE WAS CHAOS ON DECK, PEOPLE SHOUTING AND TRYING TO GET THE SCHOONER INTO OPEN SEA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
 GET TO WORK.
 YOU TELL ME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW, AND WE DROP YOU AT OUR NEXT PORT WITH YOUR POCKETS FULL OF ENOUGH COIN TO GET YOU SEWN UP AND BUY YOU PASSAGE BACK TO KERCH.
 “AND GET ME CLEAN CLOTHES AND FRESH WATER.
 WHEN THE FIGHTING HAD ENDED AND THE DUST HAD SETTLED, KING NIKOLAI HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO GET THE FEW REMAINING GRISHA SOLDIERS TRAINED AND IN THE FIELD, SO NINA HAD SPENT ONLY SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCED CLASSES BEFORE SHE’D BEEN SENT OUT ON HER FIRST MISSION.
 ZOYA HAD SHOUTED AT HER NOT TO GO PAST THE RIDGE, BUT SHE’D IGNORED HER, EAGER TO BE AS FAR AWAY FROM THE SQUALLER AS SHE COULD GET – AND WALKED RIGHT INTO A DRÜSKELLE CAMP.
” “YOU CAN’T GET TO THE ROOF,” MATTHIAS SAID WITH SATISFACTION.
 I’VE BEEN IN THE PRISON, AND THERE’S NO ACCESS TO THE ROOF FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON – IF SOMEONE MANAGES TO GET OUT OF HIS CELL, WE DON’T WANT HIM RUNNING AROUND THE ICE COURT.
 BUT IF PEKKA ROLLINS KILLS US ALL, I’M GOING TO GET WYLAN’S GHOST TO TEACH MY GHOST HOW TO PLAY THE FLUTE JUST SO THAT I CAN ANNOY THE HELL OUT OF YOUR GHOST.
 JESPER PROWLED THE DECK, CLIMBED THE RIGGING, TRIED TO GET THE CREW TO PLAY CARDS WITH HIM, CLEANED HIS GUNS.
 AND IN CASE YOU’VE FORGOTTEN, ONE OF MY FLASH BOMBS HELPED GET US OUT OF THE KETTERDAM HARBOUR.
 GET ME A SYSTEM FOR WINNING AT THREE MAN BRAMBLE OR MAKKER ’S WHEEL.
 NINA WAS BENT OVER, STRUGGLING TO GET THE SULI GIRL’S FEET INTO HER STRANGE RUBBER-SOLED SLIPPERS.
 “HELP ME GET THESE THINGS ON HER FEET.
 “NOW COME HELP ME GET HER STANDING.
” ONCE THEY WERE ON DECK, INEJ SQUEEZED HIS ARM TO GET HIM TO HALT.
 AND PRAYING NOT TO GET STUNG.
” “I’LL GET US OUT.
 HE’D SNAPPED AT HER BEFORE THEY’D LEFT KETTERDAM, TOLD HER HE’D GET A NEW SPIDER FOR THE JOB IF SHE DIDN’T THINK HE COULD PULL IT OFF.
 “THEN I’LL PRAY YOU GET ALL YOU ASK FOR.
 “WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE GET THERE?
 “I’LL GET A JOB AS A RUNNER AT THE EXCHANGE, THEN A CLERK.
 KAZ HAD CROUCHED DOWN, TURNING ALL THE KEYS, TRYING TO GET ALL THE DOGS WADDLING AT THE SAME TIME, AND THE BOY SELLING THEM HAD STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION WITH JORDIE.
 RIGHT NOW SUGAR PRICES WERE LOW, BUT WHEN PEOPLE FOUND OUT HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO GET SUGAR IN THE COMING MONTHS, PRICES WOULD SOAR.
 “WE’LL HAVE TO DO THIS AT LEAST TWO MORE TIMES BEFORE WE GET TO THE ICE COURT SO I CAN DEEPEN THE COLOUR.
 BREKKER HAD BEEN FRUSTRATINGLY TIGHT-LIPPED ABOUT HOW EXACTLY THEY WERE GOING TO REACH BO YUL-BAYUR AND THEN GET OUT OF THE ICE COURT WITH THE SCIENTIST IN TOW, BUT HE’D BEEN CLEAR THAT ONCE THEY HAD THEIR PRIZE, THE FEROLIND WAS THEIR ESCAPE ROUTE.
” “WHEN WE GET OUR MONEY, YOU CAN BURN KRUGE TO KEEP YOU WARM,” SAID KAZ.
 “IF WE GET THIS RIGHT, WE’RE GOING TO BE IN AND OUT OF THE ICE COURT BEFORE THE FJERDANS EVER KNOW THEIR PRIZE SCIENTIST IS GONE,” KAZ SAID AS THEY SHOULDERED THEIR PACKS AND CONTINUED TO PUSH SOUTH.
 ONCE WE’RE OUT OF THE CELLS, WE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST SIX HOURS TO CROSS TO THE EMBASSY, LOCATE YUL-BAYUR ON THE WHITE ISLAND, AND GET HIM DOWN TO THE HARBOUR BEFORE THEY REALISE ANYONE IS MISSING.
 “ONCE WE’RE OUT OF THE CELLS,” KAZ CONTINUED, “MATTHIAS AND JESPER WILL SECURE ROPE FROM THE STABLES WHILE WYLAN AND I GET NINA AND INEJ OUT OF THE WOMEN’S HOLDING AREA.
 “WE CROSS TO THE EMBASSY SECTOR ROOF AND GET ACCESS TO THE GLASS BRIDGE THROUGH THERE.
 WE LOCATE YUL-BAYUR AND GET HIM BACK TO THE EMBASSY.
” UNLESS MATTHIAS MANAGED TO GET TO THE SCIENTIST FIRST.
 HE’D STILL GET HIS PARDON.
 HOW DO WE GET OUT?
” JESPER AND WYLAN DEBATED WHICH KINDS OF EXPLOSIVES MIGHT BE ASSEMBLED FROM THE PRISON LAUNDRY SUPPLIES AND IF THEY COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON SOME GUNPOWDER IN THE EMBASSY SECTOR.
 BOTH OF THEM MOVED IN FITS AND STARTS, TRYING TO GET THEIR LIMBS TO OBEY, SHUDDERING WITH COLD.
 HE HAD THE DISTINCT SENSE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO LIE DOWN AND SIMPLY NOT GET BACK UP.
 MATTHIAS LABOURED OVER THE FIRE, TRYING TO GET IT TO DO MORE THAN SMOKE.
 HE’D ALMOST DIED, AND IF HE DIDN’T GET A FIRE STARTED, HE STILL MIGHT.
 HE WAS STRUGGLING TO KEEP HIS TEETH FROM CHATTERING, AND THEY WOULD NEED EACH OTHER ’S WARMTH TO GET THROUGH THE NIGHT.
” NINA BLEW OUT AN EXASPERATED BREATH AND CURLED UP ON HER SIDE, BURROWING AS CLOSE AS SHE COULD GET TO THE FIRE.
” “YOU TOLD ME TO GET CLOSER!
 THERE WERE FEW LANDMARKS HERE, AND IT WAS EASY TO GET TURNED AROUND.
 “WHAT’S THE FIRST THING YOU’RE GOING TO DO WHEN YOU GET HOME?
 “HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF THE CAGES?
 “I’D LOVE TO SEE YOU GET BEATEN BY A GIRL,” SHE SAID HAPPILY.
” “WELL, I GUESS I WON’T GET TO SEE IT.
 “WHAT WILL I SEE WHEN I GET TO THE ICE COURT?
 “IF YOU TWO KEEP FIGHTING, YOU’RE GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED, AND I HAVE A LOT MORE CARD GAMES I NEED TO LOSE.
 MAYBE SHE’D EVEN SUSPECTED HIM OF OUTRIGHT LYING TO HER ABOUT WHAT HE’D SEEN JUST TO GET HER TO DO THE JOB.
 BEFORE JESPER COULD GET OFF A SHOT, THE GRISHA RAMMED A FIST UPWARDS, AND JESPER WAS THROWN OFF HIS FEET BY A SHAFT OF EARTH.
” “DON’T GET IDEAS,” HE’D SAID WITH A LAUGH.
 WE WILL GET YOU SAFELY HOME.
 “THAT MORNING,” HE SAID, “ON THE DOCKS—” “I HAD TO GET US BOTH AWAY FROM ELLING AS FAST AS I COULD.
 “THEY WON’T GET THEIR PAY FROM THE MERCHANT COUNCIL.
 “WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
 HE’S HEARD IT’S A GOOD PLACE TO GET ROLLED, SO HE KEEPS PATTING HIS WALLET, MAKING SURE IT’S THERE, CONGRATULATING HIMSELF ON JUST HOW ALERT AND CAUTIOUS HE’S BEING.
 GOOD WAY TO GET PINCHED BY THE STADWATCH.
 HOW DO WE GET IN AND GET THE DOOR LOCKED AGAIN?
 “SO WE HAVE TO UNLOCK, UNCHAIN, AND INCAPACITATE SIX PRISONERS, TAKE THEIR PLACES, AND SOMEHOW GET THE WAGON SEALED TIGHT AGAIN WITHOUT THE GUARDS OR THE OTHER PRISONERS BEING THE WISER?
 THEY MIGHT EVEN GET TO THE COAST AND FREEDOM.
 JESPER JUST GRINNED AND WHISPERED, “WELL, WE’VE MANAGED TO GET OURSELVES LOCKED INTO THE MOST SECURE PRISON IN THE WORLD.
 GET IT TOGETHER, BREKKER, HE SCOLDED HIMSELF HARSHLY.
 HE’D TRIED TO GET JESPER TO USE IT UP ON THE FARM, BUT THE WORK HAD BEEN TOO MONOTONOUS.
 THEN JESPER AND THE OTHERS WOULD HAVE UNTIL MIDNIGHT TO GET THE JOB DONE.
 “AND YOU’RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT ABOUT IT WHEN WE GET BACK TO KETTERDAM.
 “WYLAN AND I WILL GET NINA AND INEJ OUT.
 I REALLY HOPE WE’RE NOT ALL ABOUT TO GET STUNG.
 THEY HAD FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO SEARCH THE HIGH-SECURITY CELLS, MEET BACK AT THE LANDING, AND GET TO THE BASEMENT.
 NINA KNEW SHE WAS BEING INCAUTIOUS, BUT SHE COULDN’T GET THE IMAGE OF THOSE WHITE ROOMS OUT OF HER HEAD.
 EITHER WAY, SHE HAD TO GET TO THE INCINERATOR.
 KAZ WOULD TELL HER TO JUST PUT THE GLOVES ON, TO DO WHATEVER IT TOOK TO GET THE JOB DONE.
 HE KNEW THE SCHOOLBOY WOULD HUDDLE IN THAT ALLEY FOR A LONG WHILE, WEIGHING THE SHAME OF APPEARING HALF-DRESSED IN THE STREET WITH THE NEED TO GET HOME AND TELL WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
 WANT TO GET ANYWHERE IN THE BARREL, YOU’D BEST LEARN HIS NAME.
 THERE WASN’T MUCH TIME LEFT TO GET TO THE BASEMENT.
 AND HOW WERE THEY GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS?
 “I CAN’T GET ALL THE RUBBER OFF HER HEELS,” SHE SAID, AS SHE SAW THEM APPROACHING.
” JESPER CRAWLED OVER TO GET A BETTER LOOK AT INEJ’S BLISTERED FEET, KEENLY AWARE OF KAZ TRACKING HIS MOVEMENTS.
 “YOU TAKE OFF BEFORE MATTHIAS AND I GET BACK, THEN YOU JUST DECIDE TO EXPAND YOUR SEARCH AND LEAVE NINA THINKING YOU’RE IN TROUBLE?
 “WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.
 “WE GET INEJ’S FEET PATCHED UP—” SHE FLEXED THEM, THEN STOOD, TESTING HER BARE SOLES ON THE GRAVEL.
 WE HAVE TO DO THIS BEFORE THEY GET WISE TO THE FACT THAT SIX PEOPLE ARE ON THE LOOSE IN THE OUTER CIRCLE.
 “EVEN IF YOU MANAGE TO GET TO THE WHITE ISLAND AND FIND YUL-BAYUR, WE’LL HAVE NO WAY OUT.
 “WE CUT OUR LOSSES AND TRY TO GET OUT NOW.
 “WE CAN GET THROUGH THAT CHECKPOINT AND ONTO THE WHITE ISLAND.
 WE CAN GET IN.
 “NINA AND I CAN GET INSIDE,” SHE CONTINUED.
” “KAZ, HOW ARE YOU AND MATTHIAS GOING TO GET THROUGH?
 THAT GLASS BRIDGE IS IMPRESSIVE, BUT IN AN EMERGENCY, THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE ANOTHER WAY TO GET REINFORCEMENTS TO THE WHITE ISLAND AND GET THE ROYAL FAMILY OUT.
 “WHO CARES IF YOU CAN ALL GET ONTO THE WHITE ISLAND?
” “TO GET IT OPEN?
 THE EMBASSY GATE IS A BOTTLENECK CRAMMED WITH GUESTS – THE FJERDANS AREN’T GOING TO GET TROOPS THROUGH THERE.
 BREAK IT BADLY ENOUGH THAT ANY GUARDS WHO MANAGE TO MOBILISE CAN’T GET OUT TO FOLLOW US.
 BUT HOW DO WE GET OUT?
 “WHEN WE GET BACK TO KETTERDAM, I’M TAKING MY SHARE, AND I’M LEAVING THE DREGS.
 INEJ AND NINA SHOVED THE KAELISH INTO THE CUPBOARD AND MANAGED TO GET THE DOORS CLOSED AND LOCKED, THEN YANKED ON THEIR COSTUMES.
 THE GUESTS IN THE HALLWAY SHRIEKED AND SHOVED AT EACH OTHER, TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE MESS.
 IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THEY NOT GET TOO CLOSE TO ANY OF THE REAL MENAGERIE GIRLS.
 THEY GO HOME, GET INTO BED, TOSS AND TURN, WONDERING HOW IT WAS DONE.
 NOW LET’S CLEAN UP AND GET THOSE UNIFORMS ON.
 BUT YOUR LIFE’S ABOUT TO GET A LOT MORE EXCITING.
 HE NEEDED A DOSE OF IMMINENT PERIL TO GET HIS HEAD STRAIGHT.
 THE POOR NUBS WOULD PROBABLY BE DISCOVERED BEFORE THEY MANAGED TO GET LOOSE.
 IF WE’RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THE FJERDANS CAN’T GET THE GATE OPEN, WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT THROUGH THE METAL.
 WE CAN STILL GET THIS DONE.
 IT HAD TAKEN HER TOO LONG TO GET ACROSS THAT STUPID GLASS BRIDGE.
 SHE DIDN’T RISK SO MUCH AS A NOD OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, BUT CONTINUED UP THE STAIRS TO THE BALCONY ON THE SECOND FLOOR WHERE SHE COULD GET A BETTER LOOK AT THE FLOW OF THE CROWD.
 “I THINK IT MIGHT BE BEST TO GET YOU OFF YOUR FEET.
 THEY … THEY DON’T GET MIXED UP.
 TAKE US TO THE GATE AND GET ON WITH IT.
 AND IF SHE COULD GET BRUM ALONE … SHE SWATTED HIS CHEST.
 BESIDES, IF BO YUL-BAYUR WAS ON THIS SAINTSFORSAKEN ISLAND, BRUM WAS THE ONE TO GET HER TO HIM.
 THE PLAN HAD BEEN TO FIND SOMEONE TO GIVE HER INFORMATION ON BO YUL-BAYUR ’S LOCATION, NOT TO GET COSY WITH THE HIGHEST-RANKING DRÜSKELLE ON THE WHITE ISLAND.
 KAZ HAD SWORN HE COULD GET HER OFF THIS ISLAND, BUT KAZ’S FIRST PLAN HAD GONE TO PIECES – MAYBE THIS ONE WOULD, TOO.
 GRISHA DON’T GET SICK, SHE THOUGHT.
 IF SHE COULD GET BRUM INTO AN EMPTY CORRIDOR FAR ENOUGH FROM THE ENTRANCE THAT THE GUARDS COULDN’T HEAR THEM … COULD SHE TORTURE A HARDENED DRÜSKELLE?
 AND I’LL GET TO SEE YOU DOSED WITH JURDA PAREM.
 I’LL GET TO SEE YOU BETRAY THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE AS YOU ASKED ME TO BETRAY MY OWN.
 WE’RE STILL WORKING OUT THE CORRECT RATIOS, BUT WE’LL GET THERE.
” “WE’LL GET THE GIRL TO SIGN A STATEMENT RECANTING THE SLAVING CHARGES EASILY ENOUGH.
 YOU CAN SAVE HER AND GET US YUL-BAYUR, TOO.
 JESPER HATED TO GIVE UP THE HIGH GROUND BEFORE THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE UP AGAINST, BUT THEY WERE SHORT ON TIME, AND THEY NEEDED TO GET TO THE ROOF.
 HER HEART REBELLED WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF THE GRISHA SHE’D BE LEAVING BEHIND, BUT THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET THEM TO THE HARBOUR.
 WE’LL GET THE INFORMATION FROM YOU OUR OWN WAY.
 HE HAD TO GET INSIDE THE TREASURY, BUT HE’D NEED SOME KIND OF COVER WHILE HE PICKED THAT INSCRUTABLE LOCK, AND THERE WERE DRÜSKELLE EVERYWHERE.
 “THEY’LL GET YOU TALKING.
 “DID YOU MANAGE TO GET HOLD OF A BIG ENOUGH DIAMOND?
” “JUST GET TO WORK.
 INEJ COULD ONLY HOPE SHE COULD GET THE BIG GUN WORKING.
 GET HIS SHIRT OPEN.
 IF YOUR GOD IS SO DELICATE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET A NEW ONE.
 “WE REALLY NEED TO GET HIM MORE SUITABLE FRIENDS.
 “YOU’VE SEEN—” “SOME PEOPLE DON’T GET ADDICTED AFTER THE FIRST DOSE.
” “ENOUGH TO GET HER BACK TO KETTERDAM?
” “BEHAVE OR NINA ZENIK WILL GET YOU?
 “I’M GOING TO FIND MATTHIAS BEFORE THINGS GET BAD.
” “SHE’S ABOUT TO GO THROUGH A TERRIFYING ORDEAL—” “AND WORK STILL NEEDS TO GET DONE.
 WHY LET EMPATHY GET IN THE WAY?
 WE’LL FIND A RUNNER TO GET WORD TO VAN ECK AND MAKE THE EXCHANGE ON VELLGELUK.
” BUT SHE KNEW IT WOULD GET WORSE.
 ” KUWEI HAD SUGGESTED THAT SMALL DOSES OF REGULAR JURDA MIGHT HELP NINA GET THROUGH THE DAY.
 SHE MIGHT NOT EVER GET TO AGAIN.
 BUT HE NEVER COULD HAVE FORESEEN THE WAY THEY’D BEEN CORNERED IN THE HARBOUR, AND HE CERTAINLY COULDN’T HAVE IMAGINED WHAT NINA HAD DONE TO GET THEM OUT OF IT.
 MAYBE HE REALLY SHOULD GET OUT OF KETTERDAM.
 WE’LL SEE IF HE TRIES TO BARGAIN US DOWN WHEN WE GET TO VELLGELUK.
 “LET’S GO GET RICH.
” “HE’S QUITE A TALKER WHEN YOU GET HIM IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND,” SAID KAZ, AND JESPER REMEMBERED THE BLOOD ON KAZ’S SHIRT AT THE PRISON.
 LOOKS LIKE I’M ABOUT TO GET MY WISH.
 HE’D GET HIS EXPLANATION AFTER KAZ GOT HIS MONEY.
 GET THE MONEY AND THE GIRL.
 BUT HE WAS ALREADY TURNING, ALREADY SPRINTING TO GET TO HER AS THE GRISHA ATTACKED.
 THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BUT STAND THERE LIKE FOOLS AND WATCH HER SHAPE GET SMALLER IN THE SKY – A DISTANT MOON, A FADING STAR, THEN GONE.
 THEY COULDN’T GO BACK TO THE SLAT OR GET HELP FROM PER HASKELL AND THE OTHER DREGS.
 THAT BOY COULDN’T GET HER BACK.
 AND I’M GOING TO GET MY GIRL.
 THE BOY NEXT TO THEM WAS SHU, BUT HE LOOKED FAR TOO YOUNG TO BE THE SCIENTIST THEY’D ALL BEEN SO DESPERATE TO GET THEIR HANDS ON.
 WAIT FOR YOUR MOMENT AND GET OUT.
” “I NEED TO GET A MESSAGE TO THE RAVKAN CAPITAL.
 AND WHAT DO I GET FOR THIS GENEROUS GESTURE?
 SOME WRATHFUL THING IN THIS BOY WAS BEGGING TO GET LOOSE, AND ROLLINS DIDN’T WANT TO BE AROUND WHEN IT SLIPPED ITS LEASH.
 BLESS NOA WHEELER FOR HELPING ME SOLVE THIS PARTICULAR PUZZLE AND FOR STAYING PATIENT WHEN I GET PRICKLY AND BRING OUT THE WHITEBOARD.
 ACCORDING TO KAZ, THE OLD MAN’S EXACT WORDS HAD BEEN, “TAKE ALL THAT ROPE AND HANG YOURSELF.
 IF YOU COULDN’T WALK BY YOURSELF THROUGH KETTERDAM AFTER DARK, THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST HANG A SIGN THAT READ ‘SOFT’ AROUND YOUR NECK AND LIE DOWN FOR A BEATING.
 YOU HAVE TO HANG ON THE LAST SYLLABLE A BIT.
 A PROPER THIEF CAN TELL THE WEIGHT OF A WALLET JUST BY THE WAY IT CHANGES THE HANG OF A MAN’S COAT.
 “YOU’LL HANG IN THEM NOW.
 IF IT HADN’T BEEN FOR ANYA, HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PLEADED WITH HIS CAPTAIN FOR A REASSIGNMENT.
 AND WHY DID RETVENKO EVEN HAVE TO BE HERE?
 “DON’T YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN FOLLOW ME AROUND?
 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VENTS IN THE CELL BECAUSE HE HEARD HOEDE SAY, “BE A BRAVE LAD, AND THERE’S A FEW KRUGE IN IT FOR YOU.
” “YES, BUT WE’RE AGREED THAT IF WE HAVE THE SAME RESULTS AS THE FABRIKATOR, THE COUNCIL WILL COMPENSATE ME?
 “BUT REMEMBER, IF YOU HURT THE SERGEANT, YOU HAVE NO WAY OUT OF THAT CELL.
 “WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE THAT.
 “IT’S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A COUNTRY IN DEBT TO YOU.
 “THEY DIDN’T HAVE TO SEND ALL THAT TREASURE AT ONCE.
 GEELS MAY HAVE THEM IN HIS POCKET.
 SHE KNEW GEELS WOULD HAVE HIS CREW OF HEAVILY ARMED BLACK TIPS GATHERED AT THE WESTERN ENTRANCE.
 KAZ HAD DONE HIS BEST TO TEACH HER, BUT SHE DIDN’T QUITE HAVE HIS WAY WITH BREAKING AND ENTERING, AND IT TOOK HER A FEW TRIES TO FINESSE THE LOCK.
 HER FATHER WOULD HAVE SAID THE SHADOWS WERE ABOUT THEIR OWN BUSINESS TONIGHT.
 THE BLACK TIPS’ LIEUTENANT MIGHT HAVE WRINKLES CREASING THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES AND BURGEONING JOWLS BENEATH HIS SIDEBURNS, BUT HE LOOKED CONFIDENT, EXPERIENCED.
 THE HARBOURS BELONG TO THE CITY, AND WE HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT TO THEM AS ANYONE.
 YOU’RE CUTTING INTO OUR TRAFFIC FROM THE DOCKS, AND YOU INTERCEPTED A SHIPMENT OF JURDA THAT SHOULD HAVE DOCKED TWO NIGHTS AGO.
 “WE ALL KNOW THE OLD MAN DOESN’T HAVE THE STOMACH FOR A REAL BRAWL.
 WAS THAT WHAT KAZ HAD MEANT WHEN HE SAID GEELS MIGHT HAVE THE GUARDS IN HIS POCKET?
 “SHOULD I HAVE THEM PUT A BULLET IN YOUR GOOD LEG, BREKKER?
 “WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO IS STOP HIS BELLYACHING AND BE GLAD I DIDN’T HAVE HOLST TAKE HIM DOWN WITH A HEADSHOT.
 YOU’LL JUST HAVE TO TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS ONE WOULD TURN EVEN YOUR STOMACH.
 YOU COULDN’T HAVE OUTBID ME.
” “GEELS, WHEN IT COMES TO YOU, I’D SAY I HAVE A RUNNING START.
 THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD HAVE MISSED THE PISTOL.
 WAS THAT WHY KAZ HAD INSISTED ON BRINGING BIG BOLLIGER HERE TONIGHT – SO HE’D HAVE PUBLIC CONFIRMATION THAT BOLLIGER HAD GONE OVER TO THE BLACK TIPS?
 “DON’T HAVE A GIRL.
 NO ONE THAT FINE SHOULD EVER HAVE LOOKED TWICE AT BARREL SCUM LIKE YOU, BUT SHE’S DIFFERENT.
 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW?
” “YOU DRAW ON ME AGAIN, I’LL BREAK BOTH YOUR WRISTS, AND YOU’LL HAVE TO HIRE SOMEONE TO HELP YOU TAKE A PISS.
 BUT THE NIGHT’S WORK WASN’T YET OVER, AND THE WRAITH DIDN’T HAVE TIME FOR TRAITORS.
 THE DREGS DON’T HAVE NO WATER!
 “YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME KNOW ABOUT BIG BOLLIGER,” HE SAID IN A FURIOUS WHISPER.
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY ENOUGH TO MAKE PEACE.
 USUALLY HE LIKED THE QUIET; IN FACT, HE WOULD HAVE HAPPILY SEWN MOST PEOPLE’S LIPS SHUT.
 WE’VE OUTED A TRAITOR, RE-ESTABLISHED OUR CLAIM ON FIFTH HARBOUR, AND I DON’T HAVE A SCRATCH ON ME.
” “HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ABOUT BIG BOLLIGER?
” “YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN ME MORE WARNING.
 SHE DIDN’T EVEN HAVE A SCENT.
 IT SHOULD HAVE MADE DIRECT CONTACT WITH HIS ATTACKER ’S LEGS, BUT INSTEAD IT SAILED THROUGH EMPTY SPACE.
” “WHEN A MAN LOSES HIS MONEY, HE MAY HAVE TROUBLE TELLING THEM APART.
 “I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.
 “WHAT POSSIBLE USE WOULD THE MERCHANT COUNCIL HAVE FOR ME?
 HAVE IT TESTED IF YOU LIKE.
 “YOU COULD HAVE GOT THAT ANYWHERE,” KAZ POINTED OUT.
 WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH ME?
 AND THE GOLD IN THOSE THREE SHU SHIPS MUST HAVE BEEN FABRIKATOR MADE.
 THE FJERDANS MUST HAVE SPIES DEEP IN SHU HAN OR KERCH IF THEY HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE DRUG AND BO YUL-BAYUR ’S PLANS SO QUICKLY.
” “YOU HAVE TO KNOW HE’S PROBABLY DEAD.
 NOW HAVE ONE OF YOUR LACKEYS SHOW ME TO THE DOOR.
 DESPITE WHAT HE’D SAID TO VAN ECK, THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN THE BARREL WHO DIDN’T HAVE MUCH TO LIVE FOR.
 IT’S POSSIBLE BO YUL-BAYUR IS ALREADY DEAD OR THAT HE’S GIVEN UP ALL HIS SECRETS TO THE FJERDANS, BUT WE THINK WE HAVE AT LEAST A LITTLE TIME TO ACT BEFORE THE SECRET OF JURDA PAREM IS PUT INTO PLAY.
 HE DIDN’T HAVE THE TALENT HE’D NEED IN THEIR RANKS.
 BUT I’LL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR YOU.
 AT LAST, VAN ECK ASKED, “WE HAVE A DEAL THEN?
” KAZ’S DISBELIEF MUST HAVE SHOWN.
 “SHE MAY HAVE ATTEMPTED IT,” HE SAID AS THEY RETRACED THEIR STEPS THROUGH THE GARDEN AND ALONG THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.
 IF THE DRUGGED HEALER HAD TRIED TO RETURN AT NIGHT IN A SMALL BOAT, SHE WOULDN’T HAVE HAD MUCH OF A CHANCE AGAINST THE CURRENT.
” “THE COUNCIL WILL HAVE MY HEAD.
 JUST THINK HOW MISERABLE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DISCOVER THIS CANAL RAT HAD A PATRIOTIC STREAK.
 “I DO WONDER WHAT A BOY OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE MIGHT HAVE AMOUNTED TO UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
 KAZ HAD SPENT HIS OWN MONEY TO HAVE THE SLAT’S DRAFTS SHORN UP AND ITS WALLS INSULATED.
 WHEN KAZ HAD BROUGHT HER TO THE SLAT, HE’D WARNED HER THAT HE WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO WATCH OUT FOR HER, THAT SHE’D HAVE TO FEND FOR HERSELF, AND SHE HAD.
 “HE DOESN’T HAVE THE NUMBERS TO FACE US IN THE STREETS, AND HIS COFFERS ARE TOO EMPTY TO HIRE ON MORE HANDS.
 “WE WON’T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FIFTH HARBOUR AGAIN.
 IT MUST HAVE STARTED RAINING.
 “IF I HAD TALKED TO YOU FIRST, WORD MIGHT HAVE GOT OUT—” “YOU THINK I’D LET THAT HAPPEN?
” INEJ COULD HAVE SWORN HE LOOKED DIRECTLY AT THE VENT WHEN HE SAID IT.
 JUST WHAT HAVE YOU GOT BREWING?
” KAZ MUST HAVE NODDED BECAUSE PER HASKELL LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND TOOK A SIP OF LAGER.
 “LONG AS I DON’T HAVE TO LIVE LIKE ONE.
 I’D RATHER HAVE THE CASH.
 “SOMEONE WHO SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT BETTER BEFORE HE HAD ME JUMPED.
 WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT?
 IF KAZ MANAGED THIS JOB FOR VAN ECK, THAT DAY WOULD COME MUCH SOONER THAN HE EVER COULD HAVE HOPED.
” “YOU HAVE CRUMBS ON YOUR CLEAVAGE.
 “DOES PER HASKELL HAVE PLANS TO FORGIVE MY DEBT?
 I HAVE ANOTHER CLIENT SCHEDULED IN A HALF HOUR, KAZ.
 “YOU COULD HAVE GOT THIS ANYWHERE,” SHE SAID, JUST AS HE HAD ARGUED TO VAN ECK A FEW HOURS EARLIER.
 THE FJERDANS HAVE HIM AT THE ICE COURT.
 HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I COME TO YOU, BEGGING YOU TO HELP MATTHIAS?
 “BECAUSE … BECAUSE …” “WHEN HAVE I EVER DONE SOMETHING FOR NOTHING, NINA?
 “DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FAVOURS I WOULD HAVE HAD TO CALL IN?
” “THAT MAY HAVE BEEN TRUE ONCE, NINA, BUT IT’S BEEN A VERY LONG YEAR.
 WHAT BUSINESS DID THESE PEOPLE HAVE AT HELLGATE?
 HE KNEW HE DIDN’T HAVE TO TELL HER ANYTHING BECAUSE THE LURE OF MATTHIAS’ FREEDOM HAD ALREADY OVERRIDDEN EVERY BIT OF HER GOOD SENSE.
 HE’D MADE SURE SHE DIDN’T HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE.
 THERE WERE SHACKLES ON THE WALL, DARK WITH RUST AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BLOOD.
 I WOULD HAVE DIED AT THE MENAGERIE.
 IN ANOTHER LIFE, SHE MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED HE WAS COMING TO RESCUE HER, A SHINING SAVIOUR WITH GOLDEN HAIR AND EYES THE PALE BLUE OF NORTHERN GLACIERS.
 “COULD HAVE LANDED ON THE DESERT LIZARD AGAIN.
 “YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS.
 WHATEVER THE PLEA MIGHT HAVE BEEN, IT WENT UNHEARD.
” “THEY HAVE MEDIKS.
 “COULDN’T YOU HAVE JUST ASKED HIM THE TIME OR SOMETHING?
 I HAVE UNIFORMS FOR THE STADWATCH, THE HARBOUR POLICE, AND THE LIVERY OF EVERY MERCH MANSION ON THE GELDSTRAAT.
” INEJ TOSSED KAZ THE CROW-HEADED CANE SHE MUST HAVE BEEN HIDING BENEATH HER GREY IMP COSTUME, AND KNEELED OVER MATTHIAS’ BODY WITH THE BONELIGHT.
 IF HELVAR COOPERATES, HE AND MUZZEN WILL BOTH HAVE THEIR FREEDOM JUST AS SOON AS THE JOB IS DONE.
” “CAN I HAVE WAFFLES?
 “WE’LL ALL HAVE WAFFLES.
 THE BOY SHE KNEW MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SCAFFOLD, BUT SOMETHING NEW HAD BEEN BUILT UPON IT.
 HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN DIRECTLY ONTO HER, BUT HE WAS YANKED BACKWARDS BY THE COLLAR OF HIS SHIRT.
 HE’D HAVE A GUN AND POSSESSION OF THE BOAT.
 NINA MUST HAVE BROUGHT HIM OUT OF THE STUPOR SHE’D PLACED HIM IN.
” “YOU COULD HAVE COME TO ME ON YOUR KNEES, AND MY ANSWER WOULD BE THE SAME.
” THEN A THOUGHT CAME TO HIM – VILE, BARBARIC, BUT THE ONE THING THAT MIGHT ALLOW HIM TO RETURN TO HELLGATE WITH PEACE IN HIS HEART EVEN IF HE DIDN’T HAVE A TONGUE IN HIS HEAD.
 EVEN IF HE COULD HAVE BORNE THE DISGRACE, HE’D HAVE LIVED EACH DAY AS A FUGITIVE FROM THE KERCH GOVERNMENT, A MARKED MAN.
” EVEN IF THEIR QUARRY WAS ALREADY ASHES ON THE PYRE, MATTHIAS WOULD HAVE HIS FREEDOM.
 BRUM WOULD HAVE LAUGHED IN THEIR FACES, TORN THAT PARDON TO PIECES.
 BEFORE NINA, BEFORE HELLGATE, HE NEVER WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED IT.
 HE’D HAVE HER THROWN INTO THE MOST MISERABLE CELL IN THE ICE COURT, WHERE SHE’D NEVER BE WARM AGAIN.
” “DON’T I HAVE SOME SAY IN THIS?
” “THERE YOU HAVE IT,” KAZ SAID TO JESPER.
 “USUALLY PEOPLE DON’T START HATING EACH OTHER UNTIL A WEEK INTO THE JOB, BUT YOU TWO HAVE A HEAD START.
 “YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SPEAK OF THOSE THINGS.
 “THE EMBASSY GATE WILL HAVE TO BE OPEN.
 “ANYONE ENTERING THE EMBASSY WILL HAVE THEIR PAPERS CHECKED AND CHECKED AGAIN.
 “I MAY NOT HAVE HAD YOUR … EDUCATION, BUT I’M SURE I KNOW PLENTY OF WORDS THAT YOU DON’T.
 THE ICE COURT WILL HAVE TO DIVERT RESOURCES TO MONITORING GUESTS AND PROTECTING THE ROYAL FAMILY.
 IT WAS A SUBTLE THING, BUT HE’D LEARNED TO LOOK FOR IT AT THE TABLES – THE MOMENT A PLAYER CAME AWAKE TO THE FACT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A WINNING HAND.
 MAYBE MATTHIAS SENSED IT, TOO, BECAUSE HE FOLDED HIS HUGE ARMS AND SAID, “YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU’RE UP AGAINST.
 “IF THIS WORKS THE WAY I THINK IT WILL, WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO ENTER THE ICE COURT EMPTY-HANDED.
” “WE HAVE TO SLEEP HERE?
 “I HAVE THINGS I NEED TO SEE TO AT THE SLAT.
 AND WYLAN, YOU AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHAT.
 HELLGATE WOULD HAVE BEEN PARADISE TO ME AS A CHILD.
 AND EVEN IF HE IS TOO POOR TO GIVE YOU ANY OF THEM, IT WON’T MATTER BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO KNOW YOU AS NO ONE ELSE DOES.
 I’M NOT SURE I HAVE A HEART TO GIVE ANY MORE, PAPA.
 IF SHE HADN’T BEEN RUNNING LATE, SHE WOULD HAVE LOOPED AROUND WEST STAVE OR SIMPLY TRAVELLED OVER THE ROOFTOPS – THAT WAS THE KETTERDAM SHE LOVED, EMPTY AND QUIET, HIGH ABOVE THE CROWDS, A MOONLIT MOUNTAIN RANGE OF GABLED PEAKS AND OFF-KILTER CHIMNEYS.
 THE THICK OBELISKS OF BLACK STONE WERE MANNED DAY AND NIGHT BY A SELECT GROUP OF GRISHA WHO KEPT THE TIDES PERMANENTLY HIGH OVER THE LANDBRIDGE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE CONNECTED KERCH TO SHU HAN.
 IF SHE HADN’T BEEN RUNNING LATE, THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOARD OR EVEN ON THEIR WAY OUT OF THE HARBOUR ALREADY.
 HE SUPPOSED IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE; THEY COULD HAVE BEEN ON THE BOAT WHEN IT EXPLODED.
” “YOU COULD HAVE TOLD US WE—” “THAT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF A DECOY.
 HE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED TO TAKE THEM OFF.
 INEJ HAD TRIED TO KEEP TABS ON THE TEAM, BUT SOMEONE ELSE IN THE GANG COULD HAVE BEEN SNOOPING.
 THEY SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RAISE THESE KINDS OF NUMBERS.
 SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT OF PENANCE, BUT SHE’D HELPED EVEN THE ODDS A BIT IN THE DREGS’ FAVOUR.
” “YOU SHOULD HAVE AIMED … HIGHER,” INEJ GASPED.
 WE HAVE SECRETS TO TELL!
 HE NEVER VISITED HELEEN’S GIRLS, THOUGH PLENTY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO TAKE HIM UP TO THEIR ROOMS.
 THE SAILS WERE ALREADY TRIMMED, AND THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY OUT OF THE HARBOUR IN MOMENTS, THOUGH NOT NEARLY AS FAST AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED.
” “GEELS DOESN’T HAVE THE BRAINS OR THE RESOURCES TO BITE BACK THIS FAST OR THIS HARD ALONE,” KAZ SAID.
 BUT HER AIM HAD BEEN OFF OR OOMEN WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN TALKING TO ANYONE.
 “YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES.
” “AND I’LL MAKE YOU WISH FOR DEATH, SO YOU HAVE TO WEIGH THOSE OPTIONS.
 NOW SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL FOR EVEN ANOTHER WEEK OF SCHOOL.
 A LITTLE DEEPER AND THE BLADE WOULD HAVE PIERCED THE APEX OF THE HEART.
 IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE PEACOCK FEATHER, THE TATTOO BORNE BY MEMBERS OF THE MENAGERIE, THE HOUSE OF EXOTICS.
 DEAD, HIS BONES WOULD HAVE SERVED TO HEIGHTEN GRISHA POWER, NO DIFFERENT FROM THE SHARK TEETH OR BEAR CLAWS THAT OTHER GRISHA WORE.
 NINA HAD BEEN A FOOL, BUT SHE DIDN’T HAVE TO BE A TRAITOR.
 THEY WERE FED TOUGH BREAD CRAWLING WITH WEEVILS – ONLY ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM ALIVE – AND HAD TO RATION FRESH WATER CAREFULLY SINCE THEY NEVER KNEW WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE IT NEXT.
 BRUM MUST HAVE KNOWN THE EFFECT HIS NAME WOULD HAVE.
 “YOU’LL HAVE A TRIAL,” SAID THE DRÜSKELLE.
 HOW MANY HAVE YOU SENT TO THE PYRE?
 “I SHOULDN’T HAVE SAID THAT.
 “THEY LET YOU HAVE A RAZOR?
” JESPER MUST HAVE SEEN TO MATTHIAS’ HAIR, TOO.
 IF MATTHIAS HAD BROUGHT NINA TO FACE TRIAL AT THE ICE COURT, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED THAT PERMISSION.
 YOU MUST HAVE A HUNDRED NAMES FOR ME BY NOW.
 I HAVE A PATIENT TO SEE TO.
 SHE COULD HAVE EXPLAINED WHAT SHE’D DONE THERE, THAT SHE’D NEVER MADE HER LIVING ON HER BACK, BUT IT WAS NONE OF HIS BUSINESS WHAT SHE DID OR DIDN’T DO.
 BUT THE BOY HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WAS ALWAYS THERE, AND SHE’D BEGUN TO SEE THE TRUTH OF HIM IN THE DAYS THEY’D SPENT TOGETHER AFTER THE SHIPWRECK.
 “I NEED TO SEE TO INEJ,” SHE SAID, EAGER TO HAVE HIM GONE.
 I MIGHT HAVE LOVED YOU, TOO.
 IT WAS HUMILIATING TO HAVE THESE FOREIGNERS SEE HIM VOMIT OVER THE RAILING FOR THE THIRD TIME IN AS MANY HOURS.
 TO HAVE HIM BRANDED AS A SLAVER, TOSSED ONTO A KERCH SHIP, AND THROWN IN JAIL?
 THEY SHOULD HAVE DISSUADED THESE FOOLS, BUT APPARENTLY HE WAS AS MUCH A FOOL AS THE REST OF THEM.
 “WE HAVE NO BUSINESS GOING AFTER BO YUL-BAYUR IF PEKKA ROLLINS IS INVOLVED.
 “UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME MAGICAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHICH WATCHTOWERS AND OUTPOSTS ARE ACTIVE.
 THEY MUST HAVE MADE IT ONTO THE FEROLIND.
” “YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIS FACE WHEN HE BROUGHT YOU TO ME.
 TELL ME WHY YOU DON’T HAVE THE CUP AND CROW ON YOUR ARM.
 “WHEN KAZ GOT PER HASKELL TO PAY OFF MY INDENTURE WITH THE MENAGERIE, THE FIRST THING I DID WAS HAVE THE PEACOCK FEATHER TATTOO REMOVED.
 “KAZ TOLD ME I DIDN’T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BUT MAKE MYSELF USEFUL.
 GIVEN HOW DEEP THE KNIFE HAD GONE, HER SAINTS MUST HAVE BEEN GUIDING NINA’S HAND.
 SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING HER FATHER MEND THE NETS.
 “THIS WILL HAVE TO BE SHAVED.
 THE GIRL SHE’D BECOME WOULD HAVE JUMPED WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT, AND MAYBE TAKEN ONE OF THE SLAVERS DOWN WITH HER.
 IF HE’D WANTED WIDE OPEN SPACES AND SILENCE, HE WOULD HAVE STAYED ON THE FRONTIER AND BECOME THE FARMER HIS FATHER HAD HOPED FOR.
 HE TAPPED HIS THUMBS AGAINST HIS REVOLVERS AND SAID, “WHEN THE BULLETS START FLYING, YOU MAY FIND I’M NICE TO HAVE AROUND.
 “THEY HAVE AN UNUSUAL FIRING MECHANISM, DON’T THEY?
” “NINA ZENIK, AS SOON AS I FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU’VE PUT MY KNIVES, WE’RE GOING TO HAVE WORDS.
 “THEY HAVE THIS APPLE SYRUP—” “YOU’RE NOT INVITED,” NINA SAID.
” “AS LONG AS I DON’T HAVE TO START GOING TO PARTIES.
 WOULD KAZ HAVE GONE OFF ON THAT KIND OF A MAD-DOG TEAR IF IT HAD BEEN JESPER WITH A KNIFE STUCK IN HIS SIDE?
 “THEY JUST SAID THE SAME THING AGAIN AND AGAIN: IF YOU’RE READING THIS, THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I WISH TO HAVE YOU HOME.
 “I SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN THE LIBRARY.
 STILL, IF THE FEROLIND IS INTERCEPTED, WE’LL HAVE NO WAY OUT OF DJERHOLM.
” HE DIDN’T HAVE TO SEE INEJ’S FACE TO SENSE HER SHOCK.
 EVEN THE IDEA OF BEING THIS NEAR SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE SET HIS SKIN CRAWLING.
 KAZ COULD HAVE WATCHED HIM FOR HOURS, BUT EVENTUALLY JORDIE HAD DRAGGED HIM AWAY.
 “THEY SAY THEY HAVE NO JOBS, BUT THEY MEAN THEY HAVE NO JOBS FOR A BOY LIKE ME.
 IN THE YEARS AFTER, KAZ WOULD ALWAYS WONDER WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF JORDIE HADN’T INDULGED HIM, IF THEY’D GONE TO THE HARBOUR TO LOOK AT BOATS INSTEAD, OR IF THEY’D SIMPLY BEEN WALKING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CANAL.
” “I HAVE MONEY,” SAID JORDIE.
 “JORDIE, YOU’RE A GOOD LAD, AND SOME DAY I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU’LL BE A KING OF THE EXCHANGE, BUT YOU DON’T HAVE THE KIND OF FUNDS THESE INVESTORS REQUIRE.
” “AND I EXPECT IT’S ALL YOU AND KAZ HAVE TO LIVE ON.
 “DO WE HAVE THE WRONG CORNER?
 HAVE A SEAT.
 IT’S PART OF ALL CORPORALKI TRAINING NOW, BUT I JUST DON’T HAVE AN AFFINITY FOR IT.
 I’LL CHANGE YOUR EYE COLOUR, YOUR HAIR – WHAT YOU HAVE OF IT.
 “CAN I HAVE THE KEY NOW?
” HE MUST HAVE GRIMACED BECAUSE SHE BURST OUT LAUGHING.
” IT WAS A HUMILIATING EPIPHANY, BUT HE KNEW HE COULD HAVE WATCHED HER EAT ALL DAY.
 “YOU’LL HAVE TO KEEP THEM OPEN.
 “YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ME,” SHE INSTRUCTED.
 THEY’D LIVED FURTHER SOUTH, NEAR HALMHEND, BUT IN THE WINTERS THAT PART OF FJERDA DIDN’T LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THIS, A WORLD OF WHITE AND GREY, BROKEN BY GROVES OF BLACK-LIMBED TREES AND JUTTING CLUSTERS OF ROCK THAT SEEMED TO HAVE RISEN UP FROM NOWHERE, SHIPWRECKS ON A BARE OCEAN FLOOR.
 “WE HAVE THAT COVERED.
 IF SOMEONE NOTICES BO YUL-BAYUR IS MISSING, WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO COVER THAT TERRITORY FAST.
 “AND ANYTHING WE HAVE TO BLOW UP IN BETWEEN,” ADDED JESPER.
 NINA TRIED TO HELP INEJ ESTIMATE WHAT HER PACE WOULD HAVE TO BE TO SCALE THE INCINERATOR SHAFT WITH ENOUGH TIME TO SECURE THE ROPE AND GET THE OTHERS TO THE TOP.
 “I’M GOING SOMEWHERE I NEVER HAVE TO SEE SNOW AGAIN.
 “YOUR FATHER WILL HAVE TO MOVE.
 EVERY PART OF HIM WENT INTO A PANIC, AND IF HE’D BEEN LESS SHOCKED OR NUMB, HE WOULD HAVE STRUGGLED.
 “WE HAVE TO FIND LAND,” SHE GASPED.
 HE KEPT THEM MOVING – THOUGH THEY MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN PADDLING IN A CIRCLE – AND SHE KEPT BOTH OF THEM BREATHING.
 THEY KNEW ONLY THE SEA, THE ICE, THE OCCASIONAL SPLASH THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WAVE OR SOMETHING HUNGRY MOVING TOWARDS THEM IN THE WATER.
 IF THEY’D WASHED UP EVEN A FEW MILES FURTHER UP THE COAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FOR.
 HE WAS CLUMSY AND TIRED AND HUNGRY ENOUGH THAT HE WOULD HAVE GLADLY GNAWED THE LEATHER OFF HIS BOOT.
 IT SHOULDN’T HAVE CONCERNED HIM, BUT HE DIDN’T WANT TO BE NEAR HER.
 “AND ONCE I FALL ASLEEP, ALL WE’LL HAVE IS THAT FIRE TO KEEP US WARM.
 THIS ISN’T WHERE I HAVE MY WAY WITH YOU.
 AS IF HIS WORDS COULD HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THIS WITCH.
 “THE PYRES HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL SINCE—” NINA WHIRLED ON HIM AND SHOVED HIS CHEST HARD.
” “NINA—” “DO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT NAME FOR KILLING WHEN YOU WEAR A UNIFORM TO DO IT?
” “YOU SHOULD HAVE LET INEJ DO IT.
 I HOPE THEY PUT THE DRÜSKELLE IN SHACKLES AND MAKE THEM STAND TO HEAR THEIR CRIMES ENUMERATED SO THE WORLD WILL HAVE AN ACCOUNTING OF YOUR EVILS.
” “I WANT YOU TO HAVE YOUR PARDON, HELVAR.
 I HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE.
 IF THEY DIDN’T HAVE WOOD OR KINDLING, THEY CURLED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, BARELY TOUCHING, BUT BY MORNING, THEY’D BE PRESSED TOGETHER, BREATHING IN TANDEM, COCOONED IN MUZZY SLEEP, A SINGLE CRESCENT MOON.
 ” I HAVE BEEN MADE TO PROTECT YOU.
 IF THEY HADN’T DISCOVERED THE CUP’S SECRET, SHE WOULD HAVE DROWNED IN A CAGE.
” “WHAT DO YOU DO ONCE YOU HAVE THEM?
” “I HAVE PLENTY OF FUN.
 HAVE YOU EVER ASKED ONE?
” “WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?
 DJEL, I CAN’T WAIT TO HAVE A BED TO MYSELF AGAIN.
 “WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SAY THINGS LIKE THAT?
 I HAVE BEGUILED YOU WITH MY GRISHA WILES!
 “I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, TOO.
 AN ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE RELEASED HER, BUT MATTHIAS WAS A TRAINED DRÜSKELLE.
 DOES THE ROYAL PALACE HAVE A VIEW OF THE GALLOWS?
 WHEN WE GOT TO ELLING, WE … I COULD HAVE REVEALED HER TO THE SOLDIERS WE SAW THERE AT ANY TIME.
 SHE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT WELL HAVE LOST HER MIND.
 INEJ MUST HAVE THROWN IT WHEN SHE’D ESCAPED FROM THE ENCLOSURE.
 HE SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF WHAT SHE’D JUST WITNESSED.
 IF HE HADN’T BEEN RAVAGED BY THE DRUG, HE MIGHT HAVE SURVIVED HIS WOUNDS.
 THEY COULD HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING US FOR MILES.
 “IF THEY HAVE JURDA PAREM, WHY GO AFTER BO YUL-BAYUR?
 “IF THEY HAVE MORE OF THEM,” SAID KAZ.
 “THE GROUND’S TOO HARD, AND WE DON’T HAVE THE TIME.
 NINA COULD JUST MAKE OUT KAZ’S REPLY: “PRETTY SURE MOST OF US DON’T HAVE ‘STALWART’ OR ‘TRUE’ CHECKED OFF ON OUR RÉSUMÉS.
 “NESTOR SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT,” SHE SAID, HER THOUGHTS STILL CHURNING.
 “I MAY HAVE TO SELL YOUR PRETTY HAIR TO A WIG SHOP FOR CASH.
 YOU MIGHT HAVE MADE YOUR PEACE WITH ME, BUT YOU CAN’T EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE YOU WOULDN’T HAVE REVEALED THEM.
 I THOUGHT IF I COULD JUST FIND US A VESSEL TO STOW AWAY ON … BUT THE GRISHA MUST HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE BOARDING HOUSE AND SEEN US LEAVE.
 IF THEY’D CAPTURED YOU, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO RAVKA, INTERROGATED, MAYBE EXECUTED.
 I KNEW THEY’D HAVE TO TAKE YOU INTO CUSTODY, AND BRING US SAFELY TO KERCH.
 I WOULD HAVE COMPROMISED GRISHA STILL IN THE FIELD.
” “I COULD HAVE GONE HOME TO RAVKA.
 “BUT WE HAVE A DEBT TO SETTLE, MATTHIAS.
 SHE’D HAVE TO TAILOR HIM AGAIN SOON.
 WHAT HAD GROWN UP BETWEEN THEM HAD BEEN SOMETHING FIERCER THAN AFFECTION – AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE BOTH SOLDIERS, THAT IN ANOTHER LIFE, THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALLIES INSTEAD OF ENEMIES.
” “MAYBE THEY DON’T HAVE ANYONE TO TAKE TO JAIL,” SUGGESTED WYLAN.
” “HOLD IT UP SO WE DON’T HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR UGLY FACE.
” “THEN WE HAVE TO BE ON THE EARLY WAGON,” KAZ SAID.
” “THAT’S ONLY BECAUSE YOU NEVER HAVE ANYTHING IN YOUR WALLET,” NINA SHOT BACK.
” PROPER THIEVERY ASIDE, INEJ WOULD HAVE LIKED A PROPER NIGHT’S SLEEP IN A PROPER BED, BUT THERE WOULD BE NO COMFORTABLE STAY AT AN INN, NOT IF THEY WERE GOING TO FIND THEIR WAY ONTO A PRISON WAGON AND INTO THE ICE COURT BEFORE HRINGKÄLLA BEGAN.
 “YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
” JESPER MUST HAVE ALREADY RAISED THE SIGNAL.
 THE GUARDS MIGHT HAVE ONE OF THEIR OWN IN THE BACK OF THE WAGON.
 HE’D LEFT HIS WALKING STICK BEHIND IN THE DITCH, AND WHATEVER PAIN HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FEELING, HE DISGUISED IT WELL.
 AS HE FASTENED IT AROUND HER THROAT, NINA MET HIS EYES OVER HER SHOULDER, AND THE LOOK THEY EXCHANGED COULD HAVE MELTED MILES OF NORTHERN ICE.
 IN YEARS TO COME PEOPLE WOULD CALL THE OUTBREAK OF FIREPOX THAT STRUCK KETTERDAM THE QUEEN’S LADY PLAGUE, AFTER THE SHIP BELIEVED TO HAVE BROUGHT THE CONTAGION TO THE CITY.
 BUT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO TO MEET IT.
 HE COULD HAVE BEEN ROBBED, KILLED.
 HE’D KEPT HIS GLOVES ON, SOMETHING THE GUARDS MIGHT HAVE EASILY TAKEN NOTE OF, AND A FRUSTRATING CONCESSION TO HIS WEAKNESS, BUT IF HE HADN’T, HE FELT FAIRLY SURE HE’D HAVE GONE COMPLETELY MAD.
 THIS WAS THE FIRST REAL MOMENT OF EXPOSURE, ONE KAZ WOULD HAVE NO CONTROL OVER.
 “BUT I DON’T THINK WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PEKKA ROLLINS’ TEAM ANY MORE.
 “THEY’RE CLAIMING THE PAPERS ARE OUT OF ORDER, THAT THEY HAVE A SULI GIRL INSTEAD OF A SHU BOY.
 IN THAT MOMENT, HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP HALF HIS SHARE OF THE THIRTY MILLION KRUGE FOR THE FAMILIAR HEFT OF HIS CANE.
” HE NEEDN’T HAVE BOTHERED.
 PROTOCOLS COULD HAVE CHANGED.
 HE COULD HAVE KICKED HIMSELF.
 “WE HAVE TIME.
” “THEY DON’T HAVE CITIES IN NOVYI ZEM?
 HAVE YOU EVER EVEN BEEN ANYWHERE BUT HOME, THE BARREL, AND FANCY EMBASSY DINNERS?
” “I HAVE PLENTY OF SPINE,” WYLAN GRUMBLED.
 WHEN THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH FOR THE NEXT HEAD COUNT, THE PRISONERS WOULD HAVE BAD HEADACHES BUT NOT MUCH TO TELL.
 BESIDES, I HAVE OTHER SKILLS THAT BRING ME MORE PLEASURE AND PROFIT THAN THIS.
 YOU HAVE TO LET THE MARK FEEL LIKE HE’S WON.
 ACCORDING TO WYLAN’S PLANS, THE STABLES WERE ADJACENT TO THE GATEHOUSE COURTYARD, SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO BACKTRACK THROUGH THE HOLDING AREA.
 “WE HAVE A PROBLEM,” WYLAN SAID.
” “I MAY HAVE TRIED TO POINT THAT OUT TO HIM,” INEJ SAID.
 KAZ DIDN’T HAVE HIS CANE.
 AND INEJ DIDN’T HAVE HER KNIVES.
 SHE MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY WERE OUT OF THE ICE COURT TO FIND A SOLUTION, BUT SHE COULD AT LEAST COUNT ON MATTHIAS TO HELP HER.
 WHERE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CELLS THERE WAS A STEEL DOOR, BRIGHT LIGHT SHINING BENEATH IT.
 IF A GUARD ENTERED THE CORRIDOR BEHIND HER, SHE’D HAVE NOWHERE TO HIDE.
 WITHOUT THE GLOVES, HER SKIN WOULD HAVE STARTED TO BLISTER RIGHT AWAY.
 IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN MILES.
 RUN AGAIN, AND I’LL HAVE YOU THROWN IN HELLGATE FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT.
 DIRTYHANDS MUST HAVE INFORMED ON HER.
 INEJ’S DISTRESS MUST HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS BECAUSE TANTE HELEEN LAUGHED LIGHTLY.
 HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A FIGHT?
 HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HOLDING ON TO NOTHING?
 AND HE DIDN’T HAVE MUCH TIME.
 “DON’T HAVE ANY, NUB.
 WE ALREADY HAVE A BOY WHO CLEANS THE PISSPOTS.
 “YOU HAVE NO FINESSE,” A GAMBLER AT THE SILVER GARTER ONCE SAID TO HIM.
 EVEN ONE OF THE BANK OFFICERS HAD TO HAVE BEEN IN ON IT, PASSING INFORMATION TO HERTZOON ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND TIPPING HIM OFF TO NEWCOMERS FROM THE COUNTRY OPENING ACCOUNTS.
 IT MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM AND JORDIE RICH.
 “YOU’LL HAVE TO WAIT.
 KAZ WOULD HAVE FOUR MILLION KRUGE, BUT JORDIE WOULD NEVER HAVE HIS REVENGE.
 KAZ’S REACTION THE LAST TIME INEJ WAS INJURED HAD BEEN MORE THAN A LITTLE DISTURBING, THOUGH THIS WASN’T NEARLY AS BAD AS A STAB WOUND – AND THIS TIME KAZ DIDN’T HAVE THE BLACK TIPS TO BLAME.
” “NO, YOU JUST HAVE REALLY UGLY FEET.
 I WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN IN THE STAIRWELL IF I HADN’T WASTED TIME LOOKING FOR YOU.
 “IF I HAVE TO CROSS TO THE WHITE ISLAND ALONE, I WILL.
 “THE WEST STAVE DELEGATIONS HAVE STARTED TO ARRIVE.
 BY THEN, THE PRISON GUARDS WILL HAVE COMPLETED THEIR SEARCH AND ARE GOING TO KNOW SIX INMATES GOT OUT OF THE SECTOR SOMEHOW.
 “IF ANY OF YOU SURVIVE, MAKE SURE I HAVE AN OPEN CASKET,” JESPER SAID AS HE HEFTED TWO SLENDER COILS OF ROPE OVER HIS SHOULDER AND SIGNALLED FOR WYLAN TO FOLLOW HIM ACROSS THE ROOF.
 “I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU,” SHE SAID AS SHE PULLED HIS LEATHER GLOVES FROM THE SLEEVE OF HER PRISON TUNIC.
 “YOU DON’T HAVE TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW,” SAID NINA.
 “BUT I KNOW WHY I HAVE TO FINISH.
 INEJ KNEW THAT ORDINARILY NINA WOULD HAVE USED PIGMENTS TO ALTER HER OWN HAIR COLOUR, BUT THERE SIMPLY WASN’T TIME.
 NINA’S EYES WERE GREEN AND NOT BLUE, BUT THAT KIND OF TAILORING COULDN’T BE RUSHED, SO THEY’D HAVE TO DO.
 TANTE HELEEN MUST HAVE BOUGHT HER TO REPLACE INEJ; SHE HAD THE SAME BRONZE SKIN, THE SAME THICK SHEAF OF DARK HAIR.
 INEJ WAS GLAD SHE DIDN’T HAVE TIME TO DWELL ON THE UNWELCOME FAMILIARITY OF THE SILKS ON HER SKIN, THE HORRIBLE TINKLING OF THE BELLS ON HER ANKLETS.
” “I WONDER WHAT MATTHIAS WOULD HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT OUTFIT.
 “THE NOSEBLEED PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE THE TRICK,” WHISPERED INEJ.
 “THIS DESCRIPTION SAYS YOU HAVE FRECKLES,” HE SAID IN KERCH.
 YOU HAVE VERY PRETTY EYES.
 PUT HER WITH THEM, AND WE’LL TAKE HER BACK TO THE CHECKPOINT TO HAVE HER PAPERS REVIEWED.
 “WYLAN, YOUR THOUGHTS HAVE TAKEN A VERY DARK TURN.
” “WHEN HAVE I EVER BEEN EARLY?
 FIRST, WE HAVE TO CROSS THE ICE MOAT UNDETECTED.
 INEJ MUST HAVE RETURNED THEM.
 DRÜSKELLE WOULD HAVE COME THIS WAY EARLIER TONIGHT.
 ONLY A SHORT WHILE AGO, DRÜSKELLE WOULD HAVE BEEN GATHERED IN THIS NICHE OF THE WALL TO WELCOME THEIR NEW BROTHERS ASHORE, BUT NOW IT WAS EMPTY, THE IRON GRATING CHAINED.
 AT ANY POINT, HE MIGHT HAVE DECIDED THAT MATTHIAS HAD SERVED HIS PURPOSE – ONCE HE’D HELPED THEM DRAW UP THE PLANS, ONCE THEY’D GOT PAST THE HOLDING CELLS, ONCE MATTHIAS HAD REVEALED THE SECRET BRIDGE.
 WE HAVE A PARTY TO GO TO.
 I WOULD HAVE WORN PURPLE, JESPER THOUGHT, IF I’D JOINED THE SECOND ARMY.
 “THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE PRISON SECTOR OR—” “OR MAYBE THERE ARE TWELVE BIG FJERDANS KEEPING WARM INSIDE.
 HAVE YOU EVER KILLED ANYONE?
 IT WOULD HAVE TO BE.
 HER COSTUME WOULD STILL TURN HEADS, BUT AT LEAST NOW SHE DIDN’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A BIG RED TOPKNOT GIVING AWAY HER LOCATION.
 AGAIN SHE HAD THE UNPLEASANT UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS PLACE MUST HAVE BEEN BUILT BY FABRIKATOR CRAFT IN SOME DISTANT PAST.
 SHE NEEDED SOMEONE OF HIGH-ENOUGH RANK TO HAVE ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – SOMEONE DRUNK ENOUGH TO MAKE ILL-CONSIDERED DECISIONS, BUT NOT SO DRUNK THAT HE COULDN’T TAKE HER WHERE SHE NEEDED TO GO.
 I DON’T HAVE ANY BUSINESS CRITICISING YOU.
 THEY’D JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT.
 “LET’S LET THE ICE COURT KNOW THE DREGS HAVE COME TO CALL.
 A BETTER FABRIKATOR PROBABLY COULD HAVE MADE QUICK WORK OF IT.
 ANY MINUTE NOW GUARDS WOULD BE STORMING INTO THE COURTYARD, AND THEY’D HAVE TO LEAVE OFF THIS INSANITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.
 THEY’D HAVE FAILED.
 I COULD HAVE KILLED HER, SHE THOUGHT.
 I SHOULD HAVE KILLED HER.
 “THEN YOU MUST HAVE BESTED MANY GRISHA IN BATTLE.
 HOW WOULD THE GIRL SHE WAS PRETENDING TO BE HAVE SUCH KNOWLEDGE?
 I’VE HEARD THEIR POWERS HAVE NO LIMITS.
 DID BRUM HAVE GRISHA PRISONERS STASHED SOMEWHERE?
 “I MAY HAVE EXAGGERATED THE CHARM, BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF PRIVACY, NINA.
 I REMEMBER YOUR STUBBORN LITTLE FACE FROM THE SLAVING SHIP, AND WE HAVE FILES ON EVERY ONE OF RAVKA’S ACTIVE GRISHA.
” “HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU DONE THIS?
 “YOU CAN’T HAVE KNOWN ABOUT PAREM FOR MORE THAN A MONTH.
 “WE HAVE TRIED OUR OWN METHODS FOR YEARS WITH LIMITED SUCCESS.
 WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE ALL WE’VE ACHIEVED, THE WEAPONS THEIR FABRIKATORS HAVE HELPED US DEVELOP.
” “I HAVE THE MASTER KEY,” SAID BRUM, PATTING THE DISK HANGING FROM HIS NECK, “AND HE’S GUARDED NIGHT AND DAY.
 “WE HAVE TO HELP HER.
 BUT BRUM HAD TAKEN PLEASURE IN WHAT HE’D DONE TO THESE GRISHA, WHAT HE WOULD HAVE GLADLY DONE TO NINA AND JESPER.
 IF THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN A BULLET OR A BLADE, THEY MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED, BUT THE FLECKS AND SHAVINGS OF STEEL WERE TOO MANY AND TOO SMALL.
 “JESPER, WE HAVE TO GO.
 I HAVE BEEN MADE TO PROTECT YOU.
 HE COULDN’T HAVE BEEN MORE THAN FIFTEEN.
” WHATEVER PAREM THE FJERDANS HAD BEEN USING ON THE GRISHA MUST HAVE COME FROM THE ORIGINAL STOCK BO YUL-BAYUR HAD BEEN BRINGING TO THE KERCH.
 NINA WOULD HAVE GLADLY LET BRUM DIE, BUT THOUGH MATTHIAS HAD BETRAYED HIS COMMANDER, SHE DOUBTED HE’D WANT TO SEE THE MAN WHO’D BECOME A SECOND FATHER TO HIM BLOWN TO BITS.
 HE’D THOUGHT HE’D HAVE TIME TO TELL THEM TO DEPLOY THE BALEEN BEFORE THEY WERE ALL FALLING THROUGH THE DARK.
 HOW FAR DID THEY HAVE LEFT TO GO?
 “THEY DON’T HAVE ANY MANNERS.
” SHE’D LAUGHED, AND IF HE COULD HAVE BOTTLED THE SOUND AND GOT DRUNK ON IT EVERY NIGHT, HE WOULD HAVE.
 SHE HAD TO HAVE MADE IT OUT OF THE ICE COURT.
 THERE WERE PLENTY OF OTHER DIAMONDS SHE COULD HAVE STOLEN FOR THEIR PURPOSES AND OTHER TROUBLE SHE COULD HAVE MADE TO ATTRACT THE GUARDS’ ATTENTION.
 THEY HAVE TO BE CUT, CAREFULLY, THE EDGES ASSEMBLED INTO A SINGLE PERFECT DRILL BIT.
 “THEY HAVE A BATTERING RAM,” WYLAN MOANED.
 SHE WOULD HAVE ONLY ONE OPPORTUNITY TO GRAB FOR THE IRON LANTERN THAT HUNG FROM THE CEILING OF THE ENCLOSURE.
 HER DRESS HAD FRAYED TO NEARLY NOTHING, AND IF SHE HADN’T BEEN SO DESPERATELY, GIDDILY HAPPY TO BE ALIVE AND BREATHING, SHE MIGHT HAVE WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE WAS STANDING BAREFOOT AND PRACTICALLY NAKED IN THE GORGE OF A NORTHERN RIVER, STILL A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE HARBOUR AND SAFETY.
 DOES HE HAVE A PULSE?
 MORE SKILLED CORPORALKI COULD EXTRACT THE WATER THEMSELVES, BUT SHE DIDN’T HAVE TIME TO FRET OVER HER LACK OF TRAINING.
 YOU SHOULD HAVE DROWNED.
 “WE HAVE A TANK,” MARVELLED NINA.
” “WE HAVE ONE,” MATTHIAS SAID, THEN POINTED AT THE HORDE OF METAL AND SMOKE BEARING DOWN ON THEM.
 IF THE FJERDANS WANTED TO CROSS THE GORGE, THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO FLY.
 A GROUP OF HOOTING KIDS CLINGING TO A TANK PAINTED WITH THE FJERDAN FLAG AND CHARGING ALONG LIKE SOME DERANGED FLOAT GONE ASTRAY FROM ITS PARADE; A GIRL IN PURPLE SILK AND A BOY WITH RED-GOLD CURLS POKING OUT FROM BEHIND THE GUNS; FOUR SOAKED PEOPLE HOLDING TIGHT TO THE SIDES FOR DEAR LIFE – A SHU BOY IN PRISON CLOTHES, TWO BEDRAGGLED DRÜSKELLE, AND NINA, A HALF-NAKED GIRL IN SHREDS OF TEAL CHIFFON SHOUTING, “WE HAVE A MOAT!
” SHE NEEDN’T HAVE BOTHERED.
 THE QUAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN EMPTY.
 “YOU NEVER SAID—” “THEY MUST HAVE CHANGED DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE.
” “THEY DON’T HAVE TO,” SAID NINA.
 “YOU HAVE A COUNT OF TEN TO COMPLY.
” HIS MEN MUST HAVE GOT HIM OUT OF THE TREASURY AFTER THE EXPLOSION.
” “DO YOU HAVE MORE OF THE PAREM?
 “I HAVE ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU COMFORTABLE,” KUWEI SAID.
 “I HAVE A JOB I NEED HER TO PERFORM.
 “THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT’S COMING FOR THEM.
” ONLY TWO DAYS AGO, SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT IT AT THAT, RESPECTING THEIR UNSPOKEN AGREEMENT TO TREAD LIGHTLY IN EACH OTHER ’S PASTS.
” “BARREL BOYS DON’T HAVE PARENTS.
 HOW WOULD THEY HAVE CHANGED?
 “AND HOW WILL YOU HAVE ME, KAZ?
 “HOW WILL YOU HAVE ME?
 “I WILL HAVE YOU WITHOUT ARMOUR, KAZ BREKKER.
 “I WOULD HAVE KILLED EVERY ONE OF THE DRÜSKELLE.
 ONLY INEJ WANTED TO CHAT WITH ANYONE, AND THAT WAS BECAUSE SHE SEEMED TO HAVE DEVELOPED A CONSUMING INTEREST IN ALL THINGS NAUTICAL.
 THEY’D DRINK WHATEVER SPECHT MIGHT HAVE SQUIRRELED AWAY ON THE SHIP, EAT THE LAST OF NINA’S TOFFEES, RECOUNT THEIR CLOSE CALLS AND EVERY SMALL VICTORY.
 EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A FABRIKATOR WITHOUT TRAINING, MAYBE HE COULD HAVE HELPED TO DRAW THE PAREM OUT OF NINA’S SYSTEM AND SET HER FREE.
 HELL, A HERO WOULD HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO TAKE THE PAREM WHEN THEY WERE FACING DOWN THE FJERDANS AT THE HARBOUR.
 SMUGGLERS CALLED IT VELLGELUK, ‘GOOD LUCK’, BECAUSE OF THE PAINTINGS STILL VISIBLE AROUND THE BASE OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE OBELISK TOWER: GOLDEN CIRCLES MEANT TO REPRESENT COINS, SYMBOLS OF FAVOUR FROM GHEZEN, THE GOD OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE.
” WITH A NIGGLE OF UNEASE, JESPER WONDERED WHAT ELSE ROLLINS MIGHT HAVE TOLD KAZ.
 I HAVE HIRED THE BEST TUTORS FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD.
 IF YOU’RE READING THIS, THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I WISH TO HAVE YOU HOME.
 “WHAT HAVE YOU GIVEN TO THE WORLD, MISTER BREKKER?
 YOU SEE, VAN ECK, WYLAN BET ME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT ENDING HIS LIFE.
 IT SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN.
” “A FOOL WOULD HAVE BEEN WAITING TO BE SMASHED TO BITS ON THAT SHIP.
” “YOU HAVE NO WAY OUT OF THIS, BREKKER.
 HE SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED HIS CREW.
 INSTEAD, IN THAT MOMENT OF THREAT, WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ONLY OF THE FIGHT, HE LOOKED AT INEJ.
 “YOU HAVE ONE WEEK TO BRING ME THE REAL KUWEI,” VAN ECK SHOUTED.
 YOU’LL HAVE NOWHERE TO HIDE.
” “I DIDN’T HAVE A CHOICE!
” “SAINTS, JESPER, YOU REALLY HAVEN’T LEARNED ANYTHING IN THE DREGS, HAVE YOU?
 IF HE COULD HAVE GONE AFTER INEJ ALONE, HE WOULD HAVE, BUT NOT EVEN HE COULD PULL THAT OFF.
 GOOD MUSCLE TO HAVE AROUND.
 WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE TO THIS LITTLE PISSANT?
 YOU’LL HAVE THE STADWATCH, THE KERCH ARMY AND ITS NAVY ARRAYED AGAINST YOU.
” “YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO SPARE, ROLLINS.
” “THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE NEGOTIATED BACK IN THAT CELL.
” “OTHERS HAVE TRIED.
 A TURNIP WAS HANGING FROM THE FOB WHERE HIS DIAMOND-STUDDED TIMEPIECE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
” “BECAUSE OTHERWISE I’LL HAVE TO.
 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I HAVE A DEGENERATIVE CONDITION CALLED OSTEONECROSIS.
 WE WOULDN’T HAVE MADE IT TO ‘THE END’ WITHOUT A LOT OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE.
 I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO JEAN FEIWEL, LAURA GODWIN, JON YAGED, MOLLY BROUILLETTE, ELIZABETH FITHIAN, RICH DEAS, APRIL WARD, AND THE COUNTLESS PEOPLE AT HENRY HOLT AND MACMILLAN CHILDREN’S WHO HAVE HELPED BRING THE GRISHA WORLD TO LIFE AND WHO LET ME CONTINUE TO EXPLORE IT WITH READERS.
 I CAN FACE JUST ABOUT ANY CHALLENGE KNOWING YOU HAVE MY BACK.
 AND DEAREST LULU, YOU HAVE FAILED YOUR CITY.
” JOOST FELT HIS FACE HEAT AGAIN.
 JESPER FELT THE HEAT EMANATING FROM THE INCINERATOR AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED.
 THE HEAT WAS NOTHING, MERE DISCOMFORT.
 EVEN THROUGH THE LEATHER, SHE COULD FEEL THE DENSE HEAT OF THE BRICKS.
 THE HEAT OF THE INCINERATOR WRAPPED AROUND INEJ LIKE A LIVING THING, A DESERT DRAGON IN HIS DEN, HIDING FROM THE ICE, WAITING FOR HER.
 JESPER PUT HAND OVER HAND, PULLING HIMSELF UP FROM KNOT TO KNOT, HIS ARMS BEGINNING TO ACHE, THE ROPE CUTTING INTO HIS PALMS, BRACING HIS FEET AGAINST THE WALL OF THE INCINERATOR WHEN HE NEEDED TO, THEN RECOILING AT THE HEAT OF THE BRICKS.
 NINA FELT IT BEFORE SHE HEARD IT: A WAVE OF HEAT LIFTED HER OFF HER FEET AND TOSSED HER IN THE AIR, CHASED BY A DEAFENING BOOM.

 “AT THE ICE COURT.
 “THE ICE COURT HAS NEVER BEEN BREACHED.
 KAZ DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ESPIONAGE OR GOVERNMENT SQUABBLES, BUT WHY SHOULD STEALING BO YUL-BAYUR FROM THE ICE COURT BE ANY DIFFERENT FROM LIBERATING VALUABLES FROM A MERCHER ’S SAFE?
 TO INFILTRATE THE IMPENETRABLE ICE COURT AND SNATCH A PRIZE FROM THE BASTION OF FJERDAN NOBILITY AND MILITARY MIGHT?
” “FROM WHAT I KNOW OF THE ICE COURT, WHOEVER STOLE MY DEKAPPEL IS EXACTLY WHO I NEED FOR THIS JOB.
 BUT IF KAZ HAD ANY HOPE OF GETTING INTO THE ICE COURT, HE NEEDED THE RIGHT CREW, AND THE NEXT HOUR ’S BUSINESS WOULD BRING HIM A STEP CLOSER TO SECURING TWO VERY VITAL PIECES OF THE PUZZLE.
 BUT IF BO YUL-BAYUR IS ALIVE, SOMEONE IS GOING TO TRY TO BREAK HIM OUT OF THE ICE COURT.
” “THE ICE COURT,” NINA REPEATED, AND KAZ KNEW SHE’D BEGUN TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER.
 IN ALL HIS DREAMS HE HUNTED HER, SOMETIMES THROUGH THE NEW GREEN MEADOWS OF SPRING, BUT USUALLY THROUGH THE ICE FIELDS, DODGING BOULDERS AND CREVASSES WITH UNERRING STEPS.
 AND NOW THIS DEMON WAS TALKING ABOUT BREAKING INTO THE ICE COURT, ABOUT GETTING MATTHIAS TO COMMIT TREASON.
 THEN BREKKER HAD STARTED TALKING – ABOUT A DRUG CALLED JURDA PAREM, ABOUT AN IMPOSSIBLY HIGH REWARD, AND ABOUT THE ABSURD IDEA OF ATTEMPTING A RAID ON THE ICE COURT.
 “WE CAN’T BREAK INTO THE ICE COURT BLIND.
 “YOU CAN’T BREAK INTO THE ICE COURT AT ALL.
 TO REVEAL THE SECRETS OF THE ICE COURT, TO SEE HIS HOMELAND ONCE MORE ONLY TO KNOW THAT EVERY STEP HE TOOK THERE WAS AN ACT OF TREASON – COULD HE DO SUCH A THING?
 WHAT IF MATTHIAS SAID NO AND AGAINST ALL ODDS BREKKER AND HIS CREW STILL FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE ICE COURT AND STOLE THE SHU SCIENTIST?
 IF HE WAS PART OF THIS MISSION, MATTHIAS COULD MAKE SURE BO YUL-BAYUR NEVER TOOK ANOTHER BREATH OUTSIDE THE ICE COURT’S WALLS, OR HE COULD ARRANGE FOR SOME KIND OF ACCIDENT ON THE TRIP BACK TO KERCH.
 “I’VE BEEN TO THE ICE COURT.
” “AND SINCE WYLAN HAS SEEN THE ICE COURT WITH HIS VERY OWN EYES,” KAZ CONTINUED, “HE CAN HELP KEEP YOU HONEST, HELVAR.
 FINALLY, THE FJERDAN SHUT HIS EYES, TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND SAID, “THE ICE COURT IS ON A BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE HARBOUR AT DJERHOLM.
 BEYOND THAT IS THE ICE MOAT, THEN AT THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING, THE WHITE ISLAND.
 “THE BUILDINGS OF THE OUTER CIRCLE SURROUND THE ICE MOAT, AND AT THE MOAT’S CENTRE IS THE WHITE ISLAND, WHERE THE TREASURY AND THE ROYAL PALACE ARE.
 THE ICE MOAT IS WATCHED FROM MULTIPLE GUARD TOWERS ON THE WHITE ISLAND AND A LOOKOUT ATOP THE ELDERCLOCK.
 MAYBE WE SHOULDN’T WORRY ABOUT BREAKING INTO THE ICE COURT.
” “VISITORS ARE VETTED WEEKS BEFORE THEY ARRIVE AT THE ICE COURT,” MATTHIAS SAID.
 “AND THE ICE COURT IS LIKE ANY OTHER MARK, ONE BIG WHITE PIGEON READY FOR THE PLUCKING.
 I WANT YOU WORKING ON THE PLAN OF THE ICE COURT EVERY MINUTE UNTIL WE SAIL.
 THE ICE COURT HAD BEEN BUILT TO WITHSTAND AN ONSLAUGHT OF ARMIES, ASSASSINS, GRISHA, AND SPIES.
 SHE WAS SO TIRED SHE DIDN’T ENTIRELY TRUST HERSELF TO MAKE THE CLIMB OVER THE GABLES, NOT AFTER TWO NIGHTS WITHOUT SLEEP AND A DAY SPENT WRANGLING SUPPLIES FOR THEIR TREK TO THE ICE COURT.
 HIS HAIR WAS LONG AND BURNISHED GOLD, AND HIS PALE BLUE EYES GLINTED LIKE ICE BENEATH A WINTER SUN.
 AS BAD AS IT WAS, THE FEAR OF WHAT MIGHT AWAIT THEM WAS MUCH MORE FRIGHTENING – THE INQUISITORS AT THE ICE COURT, TORTURE, AND INEVITABLY DEATH.
 “FIFTEEN GRISHA TO DELIVER TO THE ICE COURT!
” HE SAID NOTHING, JUST WATCHED HER WITH THOSE ICE CHIP EYES.
 BREKKER GESTURED MATTHIAS OVER TO WHERE HE, JESPER, AND WYLAN HAD GATHERED ON THE FORECASTLE DECK TO EXAMINE PLANS OF THE ICE COURT AWAY FROM THE EYES AND EARS OF THE CREW.
” THEN HE TAPPED THE ICE COURT PLANS.
 WOULD ANYONE AT THE ICE COURT EVEN RECOGNISE HIM?
 HE WOULD BE A STRANGER WHO HAD NO BUSINESS IN THE ICE COURT, AND BY THE TIME HE GOT ANYONE TO LISTEN— “YOU’RE HOLDING BACK,” BREKKER SAID, HIS DARK EYES TRAINED ON MATTHIAS.
 THE PRISON SECTOR IS COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE ICE COURT.
 THERE WAS LITTLE TO DO ON THE SHIP BUT STUDY THE LAYOUT OF THE ICE COURT, LISTEN TO MATTHIAS GRUMBLING, AND ANNOY WYLAN, WHO COULD ALWAYS BE FOUND LABOURING OVER HIS ATTEMPTS TO RECONSTRUCT THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF THE RINGWALL GATES.
 “OR WHAT ABOUT THE ICE MOAT?
 MATTHIAS HAD SAID THE MOAT WASN’T SOLID, ONLY A SLICK, WAFERTHIN LAYER OF ICE OVER FRIGID WATER, THOROUGHLY EXPOSED AND IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS.
 WE DON’T NEED TO CROSS THE ICE MOAT.
 MOST OF WYLAN’S PLANS SHOWED THE ICE COURT FROM ABOVE, BUT THE PRISON ELEVATION WAS A SIDE VIEW, A CROSS-SECTION SHOWING THE BUILDING’S FLOORS STACKED ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER.
 HE NEEDED TO KNOW THAT SHE BELIEVED HE COULD DO THIS, THAT HE COULD TAKE THEM INTO THE ICE COURT AND BRING THEM OUT FEELING WHOLE AND RIGHTEOUS THE WAY HE’D DONE WITH OTHER CREWS ON OTHER JOBS.
 THE CHANCE THAT—” “THE ODDS OF YOU BEING RECOGNISED WILL BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER AT THE ICE COURT, AND I CAN’T MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR APPEARANCE ALL AT ONCE.
 SPRING WAS COMING, BUT ICE WAS STILL THICK ON THE GROUND, AND IT WAS A TOUGH CLIMB.
 THE ICE BORE THE SPIRIT OF DJEL.
 THE ICE BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD, OF HUNTING WITH HIS FATHER.
 AT THE EMBASSY GATE, ALL EYES WILL BE FOCUSED ON GUESTS COMING INTO THE ICE COURT.
 THERE ARE SEVEN MILES OF ROAD BETWEEN THE ICE COURT AND THE HARBOUR.
” FURTHER SOUTH THEY TRAVELLED, THE COAST LONG GONE, THE ICE BROKEN MORE AND MORE BY SLASHES OF FOREST, GLIMPSES OF BLACK EARTH AND ANIMAL TRACKS, PROOF OF THE LIVING WORLD, THE HEART OF DJEL BEATING ALWAYS.
 THERE, IN THE DISTANCE, HE COULD JUST MAKE OUT A JUTTING PROMONTORY OF ICE AND THE BLESSED BLACK SLASH OF A DARK GRAVEL SHORE.
 YOU WORSHIP WOODSPRITES AND ICE SPIRITS WHO CAN’T BE BOTHERED TO SHOW THEMSELVES, BUT YOU SEE REAL POWER, AND YOU CAN’T WAIT TO STAMP IT OUT.
 THERE WERE DAYS WHEN THEIR HUNGER AND THE GLARE OFF THE NORTHERN ICE HAD THEM MOVING IN CIRCLES, BACKTRACKING, FALTERING OVER THEIR OWN STEPS, BUT THEY NEVER SPOKE OF IT, NEVER SAID THE WORD LOST, AS IF THEY BOTH KNEW THAT WOULD SOMEHOW BE ADMITTING DEFEAT.
” THE NEXT MORNING, THEY PICKED THEIR WAY ACROSS AN ICE FIELD SPLINTERED BY JAGGED CREVASSES, KEEPING TO THE SOLID EXPANSES BETWEEN THE DEADLY RIFTS, AND ARGUING ABOUT NINA’S SLEEPING HABITS.
 YOU—” NINA’S VOICE BROKE OFF IN A SCREAM AS THE ICE GAVE WAY BENEATH HER FEET.
 PART OF NINA WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE MOMENT BEFORE EVERYTHING HAD GONE WRONG, TO THOSE LONG DAYS ON THE ICE WHEN THEY’D MANAGED TO BE NINA AND MATTHIAS INSTEAD OF GRISHA AND WITCHHUNTER.
 ALL AROUND THEM, CROOKED MONOLITHS OF EARTH AND ICE BURST UPWARDS, AS IF THE GROUND WAS COMING TO LIFE.
 THE SQUALLER TURNED IN THE AIR, STIRRING THE STORM INTO A FRENZY, SENDING ICE FLYING UNTIL IT STUNG HER CHEEKS.
 SHE FELL BACKWARDS AS ANOTHER SLAB OF ROCK AND ICE SHOT FROM THE GROUND.
 ANOTHER SLAB OF ICE SLID INTO PLACE.
 ICE AND BITS OF ROCK RAINED DOWN OVER THEIR HEADS.
” “DO YOU THINK THEY’LL USE DRUGGED GRISHA TO TRY TO BREAK INTO THE ICE COURT?
 THE ICE DOES NOT FORGIVE.
 “BO YUL-BAYUR WILL NOT LEAVE THE ICE COURT ALIVE.
 INEJ GLANCED UP TO WHERE THE ICE COURT STOOD LIKE A GREAT WHITE SENTINEL ON A MASSIVE CLIFF OVERLOOKING THE HARBOUR.
 THE UPPER TOWN WAS A RAMBLING EXTENSION OF THE CITY BELOW, A SPRAWLING COLLECTION OF SHOPS, MARKETS, AND INNS THAT SERVED THE GUARDS AND STAFF WHO WORKED AT THE ICE COURT AS WELL AS VISITORS.
 ONE WAY INTO THE ICE COURT AND ONE WAY OUT.
” “THE ICE COURT IS A VAST STRUCTURE,” MATTHIAS SAID, TURNING AWAY.
 UPPER DJERHOLM HAD NO REAL CENTRE, BUT THE BULK OF ITS TAVERNS, INNS, AND MARKET STALLS WERE CLUSTERED AROUND THE BASE OF THE HILL LEADING TO THE ICE COURT.
” FROM THEIR TABLE, THEY HAD A CLEAR, IF DISTANT, VIEW OF THE ICE COURT’S OUTER GATE AND THE FIRST GUARDHOUSE.
 THE GATE BETWEEN THE RAMPANT WOLVES WAS WROUGHT IRON, BEARING THE SYMBOL OF THE SACRED ASH AND BORDERED BY A HIGH, SPIKED FENCE THAT CIRCLED THE ICE COURT’S GROUNDS.
” KAZ GAVE A NOD TO THE PRISON WAGON, NOW RUMBLING ITS WAY UP THE ROAD TOWARDS THE ICE COURT AND THE SECOND CHECKPOINT.
 IT HAD TAKEN NINA LESS THAN AN HOUR TO DISCOVER THAT MOST OF THE PRISON WAGONS PASSED BY A ROADHOUSE KNOWN AS THE WARDEN’S WAYSTATION ON THE ROUTE TO THE ICE COURT.
 WELL, THEN THEY’D BE CAPTIVES ON THEIR WAY INTO THE ICE COURT.
 HE WAS ICE COLD AND IN DARKNESS.
 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHAT MIGHT BE GLASS OR ICE OR STONE.
 KAZ KNEW HE SHOULD BE GLAD ANOTHER TEAM HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT, BUT ROLLINS WAS NO FOOL, AND THE THOUGHT THAT HIS CREW HADN’T MADE IT PAST THE ICE COURT GATES WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE NERVE-RACKING.
 SHE’D EVEN DREAMED OF ENTERING THE ICE COURT AS A SPY JUST LIKE THIS, OF STRIKING AT THE HEART OF THIS NATION THAT HATED HER SO MUCH.
 PART 5 THE ICE DOES NOT FORGIVE EIGHT BELLS W HERE THE HELL IS KAZ?
 THAT SECTOR IS ALREADY SEALED OFF FROM THE REST OF THE ICE COURT, SO THEY’LL AUTHORISE A SEARCH, PROBABLY TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO’S MISSING FROM THE CELLS.
 THE WHOLE ICE COURT IS A MASTERPIECE OF FAIL-SAFES AND DOUBLED SYSTEMS.
 IT APPEARED IN BRIEF FLASHES BETWEEN PARTYGOERS – TWO WOLVES CHASING EACH OTHER, DESTINED TO MOVE IN CIRCLES FOR AS LONG AS THE ICE COURT STOOD.
 OR MAYBE THE ICE COURT HAD REALLY BIG RATS.
” JESPER SAID AS THEY RACED OVER THE ROOF, CATCHING GLIMPSES OF THE ELEGANT COURTYARDS BELOW, EACH BUILT AROUND A BURBLING FOUNTAIN AND DOTTED WITH RUSTLING ICE WILLOWS.
 MORE THAN ANY PLACE IN THE ICE COURT, MORE THAN ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD, THIS FELT LIKE HOME TO HIM.
 THEY REACHED THE LIP OF THE ROOF OVERLOOKING THE ICE MOAT.
 THE SHORE SURROUNDING THE ICE MOAT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A SLENDER, SLIPPERY RIND OF WHITE STONE.
 IF YOU’D MADE FRIENDS, IF YOU’D PROVEN YOURSELF, THEN ONE OF THE BROTHERS WOULD TAKE YOU ASIDE AND TELL YOU THAT ON THE NIGHT OF THE INITIATION, YOU SHOULD GO TO THE SHORE OF THE ICE MOAT AND RUN YOUR HAND ALONG THE WALL OF THE DRÜSKELLE SECTOR.
 HE RESTED HIS HAND THERE BRIEFLY, FEELING THE TRADITIONS THAT CONNECTED HIM TO THE ORDER OF DRÜSKELLE, AS OLD AS THE ICE COURT ITSELF.
 LIKE THE PRISON, THIS PART OF THE ICE COURT WASN’T INTENDED FOR PUBLIC EYES.
 IT WAS THE ONE PART OF THE ICE COURT HE’D SEEN THAT WASN’T WHITE OR GREY.
 ALL AROUND HER PEOPLE LAUGHED AND CLUNG TO ONE ANOTHER AS THEY CLIMBED HIGHER ABOVE THE ICE MOAT, ITS SURFACE SHINING BELOW, A NEAR-PERFECT MIRROR.
 FJERDANS CLAIMED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ICE COURT WAS THE WORK OF A GOD OR OF SËNJ EGMOND, ONE OF THE SAINTS THEY CLAIMED HAD FJERDAN BLOOD.
 OR HAD THE ICE COURT BEEN BUILT IN A TIME BEFORE GRISHA HAD COME TO BE VIEWED AS MONSTERS BY THE FJERDANS?
 BUT FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT SHE SAW THE WALL HAD BEEN CRAFTED IN THE SHAPE OF A LEVIATHAN, A GIANT ICE DRAGON CIRCLING THE ISLAND AND SWALLOWING ITS OWN TAIL.
 THE PALACE WAS MADE OF THE SAME CLEAN, WHITE, UNADORNED STONE AS THE ICE COURT WALLS, AND THE WHOLE PLACE FELT AS IF IT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED OUT OF A GLACIER.
 THEN THE BELLS OF THE ELDERCLOCK RANG OUT, LOUD AND PANICKED, HIGH AND DEMANDING, AN ESCALATING TIDE OF ECHOES, CLIMBING ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER, BOOMING OVER THE WHITE ISLAND, THE ICE MOAT, THE WALL.
 “I THREW YOUR GIRL IN THE ICE MOAT,” INEJ SNARLED, BARELY RECOGNISING HER OWN VOICE.
 IF YOU LIKE ICE AND MORE ICE.
 MAYBE I’LL MAKE YOU IMPOTENT, NINA THOUGHT GRIMLY, AS HE LED HER OUT OF THE BALLROOM AND THROUGH A TERRACED FOREST OF ICE SCULPTURES – A WOLF WITH A SCREAMING DOUBLE EAGLE IN ITS JAWS, A SERPENT WRAPPED AROUND A BEAR.
 KAZ HAD SAID HE’D BE IN THE MOST SECURE PLACE IN THE ICE COURT.
 “WELCOME TO THE ICE COURT, NINA ZENIK.
 THE ICE COURT IS SECURE.
 THEN HE’D TAKEN COVER BEHIND AN ICE SCULPTURE AND FOCUSED ON THE MISERABLE TASK OF REGURGITATING THE PACKETS OF WYLAN’S ROOT BOMBS HE’D SWALLOWED BEFORE THEY’D AMBUSHED THE PRISON WAGON.
 HE’D WONDERED WHERE THE WATER THAT FED THE ICE COURT’S MOAT AND FOUNTAINS CAME FROM, WHY THE RIVER GORGE WAS SO VERY DEEP AND WIDE.
 THAT WAS THE KEY, AND ONCE KAZ RECOGNISED IT, IT WAS AS IF SOMEONE HAD LAID A PERFECT BLUEPRINT OVER THE ICE COURT AND ITS WORKINGS.
 FORTUNATE PEOPLE DIDN’T END UP RACING ASS OVER TEAKETTLE BENEATH AN ICE MOAT IN HOSTILE TERRITORY.
 THEY’D COME TO THE ICE COURT SCURRYING LIKE RATS.
” SHOUTED JESPER AND THEY SLAMMED INTO THE ICE COURT’S LEGENDARY, IMPENETRABLE WALL WITH A JAW-SHATTERING CRASH.
 HE’D PUSHED OUT OF THE NICHE OF THE DOME AND WAS LOOKING BACK AT THE ICE COURT.
 IN THE DISTANCE, SHE COULD HEAR THE BELLS OF THE ICE COURT RINGING.
 THEY’D BLOWN UP A BUILDING AT THE HEART OF THE ICE COURT.
 A RUMBLING BEGAN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ICE COURT.
 GIVEN THE FIREPOWER CONTAINED BEHIND THE ICE COURT’S WALLS, SHE SUPPOSED THEY SHOULD COUNT THEMSELVES LUCKY.
 THE ICE COURT LOOMED OVER THE HARBOUR, PERCHED ON THE CLIFF LIKE A SULLEN GULL WITH FEATHERS RUFFLED, ITS WHITE STONE WALLS LIT FROM BELOW, GLOWING AGAINST THE NIGHT SKY.
 JESPER HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE THEY WOULDN’T MAKE THIS JOURNEY HOME AT ALL, THAT THEY’D END UP IN CELLS IN THE ICE COURT OR SKEWERED ON PIKES.
 NINA HAD DISGUISED KAZ’S CROW-AND-CUP TATTOO BEFORE THEY’D ENTERED THE ICE COURT, BUT HE HADN’T LET HER NEAR THE R ON HIS BICEP.
 THE LITTLE CANAL RAT HAD MANAGED TO MAKE IT TO THE ICE COURT AFTER ALL.
 “I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU SORRY LOT WERE THE ONES TO SUCCESSFULLY RAID THE ICE COURT.
 BUT UNLIKE THOSE POOR STOOGES AT THE ICE COURT, VAN ECK WOULD BE READY FOR BREKKER.

 INEJ’S DEBT TO PER HASKELL MEANT SHE GAMBLED HER LIFE EVERY TIME SHE TOOK ON A NEW JOB OR ASSIGNMENT, EVERY TIME SHE LEFT HER ROOM AT THE SLAT.
 IT WAS HER JOB TO KNOW THAT GEELS TRUSTED ELZINGER BECAUSE THEY’D COME UP THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE BLACK TIPS TOGETHER, AND BECAUSE ELZINGER WAS BUILT LIKE A STACK OF BOULDERS – NEARLY SEVEN FEET TALL, DENSE WITH MUSCLE, HIS WIDE, MASHED-IN FACE JAMMED LOW ON A NECK THICK AS A PYLON.
 SO WHY COULDN’T SHE JUST DO HER JOB AND SPARE HIM HER MOODS?
 WHAT KIND OF JOB WOULD THIS BE?
 WITH A JOB LIKE THIS UNDER HIS BELT AND THAT KIND OF SCRUB AT HIS FINGERTIPS, HE WOULDN’T NEED PER HASKELL ANY MORE.
 HE HADN’T MENTIONED ANY BIG JOB TO HER.
 IT WAS ONE THING TO DO HER JOB AND DO IT WELL.
 “I’VE GOT A JOB FOR YOU,” KAZ SAID AS HE FLIPPED THROUGH THE PREVIOUS DAY’S FIGURES.
 IT’S A JOB FOR YOU TO TAKE OR LEAVE AS YOU SEE FIT.
 MOST GRISHA CORPORALKI FOCUSED ON THE BODY – TO KILL OR TO CURE – BUT NINA HAD NEEDED A JOB THAT WOULD KEEP HER IN KETTERDAM AND OUT OF TROUBLE.
 IF THIS JOB DOESN’T COME OFF, NO ONE’S GOING TO WANT TO BE AROUND ME SOBER.
 HRINGKÄLLA IS GOING TO DO THAT JOB FOR US.
 YOU’RE WORKING WITH ME ON A JOB AT A COUNTRY HOUSE OUTSIDE THE CITY.
” “THIS ISN’T A JOB FOR TRAINED SOLDIERS AND SPIES.
 KAZ HAD WARNED THEM TO ANTICIPATE COMPETITION, OTHER TEAMS BENT ON GAINING THE PRIZE AT ANY COST, BUT THIS WAS EARLY IN THE JOB FOR THINGS TO BE GOING SO BADLY.
 WHOEVER HAD REMOVED IT HAD DONE AN UGLY JOB OF IT.
 WE PULL OFF THIS JOB AND DIVVY UP THAT HAUL, WE’LL BE THE LEGENDS OF THE BARREL.
” “WE DON’T NEED A SHARPSHOOTER FOR KAZ’S PLAN, SO WHAT’S YOUR JOB – OTHER THAN STALKING AROUND MAKING EVERYONE ANTSY?
 KAZ HAD BEEN CLEAR THAT INFORMATION EVEN REMOTELY RELATED TO THE JOB MUST BE KEPT AMONG THE SIX OF THEM.
 YOU KNOW HOW RISKY THIS JOB IS, WHAT THE CHANCES ARE THAT WE’LL COME BACK.
 THIS JOB WASN’T LIKE ANYTHING HE’D ATTEMPTED BEFORE.
 HE’D BEEN HOPING TO LAND A JOB AS A RUNNER, TOO.
 YOUR JOB IS TO KEEP THEM FROM KILLING EACH OTHER.
 IT WAS HIS JOB TO BRING THEM OUT AGAIN.
 NO JOB TOO RISKY.
 HE QUICKLY EARNED A REPUTATION FOR BEING WILLING TO TAKE ANY JOB A MAN NEEDED DONE, AND THE NAME DIRTYHANDS SOON FOLLOWED.
 “WHAT JOB ISN’T?
 THIS WASN’T A JOB SHE WAS PERFORMING TO PAY OFF HER DEBT TO PER HASKELL.
 MAYBE NOW THAT THE JOB WAS COMPLETE AND HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO HIS SHARE OF THE HAUL, WYLAN WAS DONE SLUMMING WITH CRIMINALS.
” “YOU ARE,” REPLIED JESPER, “BUT I MAY KEEL OVER AT ANY MOMENT, SO PAY ATTENTION.
 JOOST SCRAMBLED TO KEEP HIS FOOTING, GRABBING FOR THE DOORFRAME.
 “ENOUGH TO KEEP MY TRAP SHUT.
 BESIDES, HE DISCOVERED IN A BURST OF SHAME, I WANT TO KEEP MY JOB.
 THOUGH, IF THE BLACK TIPS THOUGHT TRICKS LIKE THIS WOULD KEEP THE WRAITH FROM HER GOAL, THEY WERE SADLY MISTAKEN.
 LIKE MOST OF THE BUILDINGS IN KETTERDAM, THE EXCHANGE HAD A SHARPLY GABLED ROOF TO KEEP OFF HEAVY RAIN, SO THE GUARDS PATROLLED THE ROOFTOP VIA A NARROW WALKWAY THAT OVERLOOKED THE COURTYARD.
 IT DOESN’T KEEP ITS VALUE IN THE SPENDING.
 “GO AND TELL YOUR GENERAL TO KEEP THE BLACK TIPS OUT OF FIFTH HARBOUR AND THAT WE EXPECT HIM TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE SHIPMENT OF JURDA WE LOST, PLUS FIVE PER CENT FOR DRAWING STEEL ON NEUTRAL GROUND AND FIVE PER CENT MORE FOR BEING SUCH A SPECTACULAR BUNCH OF ASSES.
 KAZ DISPATCHED TWO OF THEM TO KEEP AN EYE ON BIG BOL AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IF HE MADE IT TO HIS FEET, HE LEFT THE CITY.
” JESPER SCOWLED, BUT HE COULDN’T KEEP THE HUNGRY GLEAM FROM HIS EYE.
” “IF THE SHU HAVE THE FORMULA—” “YUL-BAYUR CLAIMED HE’D MANAGED TO MISLEAD HIS SUPERIORS AND KEEP THE SPECIFICS OF THE FORMULA SECRET.
” “THEY’LL SING YOUR PRAISES ONCE YOU HAVE BO YUL-BAYUR SAFELY HIDDEN AWAY WHEREVER YOU INTEND TO KEEP HIM.
 “AND KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN,” JESPER ADDED, GLANCING AT THE TOURISTS AND SAILORS SEATED AT THE NEIGHBOURING TABLES.
 IT WAS ONE OF THE INFINITE TINY WAYS HE’D FOUND TO MAKE HIMSELF STRONG AT PEKKA’S EXPENSE – INTERCEPTING HIS SHIPMENTS OF JURDA, CHARGING HIM FEES FOR ACCESS TO FIFTH HARBOUR, UNDERCUTTING HIS RENTS TO KEEP HIS PROPERTIES FREE OF TENANTS, AND SLOWLY, SLOWLY TUGGING AT THE THREADS THAT MADE UP HIS LIFE.
 THE TOURISTS AND MERCHERS LIKED TO KEEP TO WELL-LIT THOROUGHFARES, SO THE FOOT TRAFFIC HERE WAS SPARSER, AND HE MADE BETTER TIME.
 THEY WERE A WAY TO KEEP EMPLOYEES SAFE AND HONEST, AND THEY OFFERED A THRILL TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYED WATCHING OTHERS TAKE THEIR PLEASURE.
 “THEY STILL KEEP PRISONERS HERE?
 BUT HE’LL KEEP TO ANY DEAL YOU STRIKE WITH HIM.
 “YOU CAN KEEP YOUR MONEY.
 HE’D HUNT HER IN KERCH, IN RAVKA, WHATEVER HOLE OR CORNER OF THE WORLD SHE THOUGHT WOULD KEEP HER SAFE.
 IT’S WHERE THEY KEEP THE MOST DANGEROUS CRIMINALS.
 I DON’T THINK THEY’LL KEEP HIM LOCKED UP WITH THE RABBLE.
” “IT’S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL YOUR WISDOM.
 JESPER COULDN’T KEEP THE DISDAIN FROM HIS VOICE.
 AND YOU CAN KEEP AN EYE ON JESPER, TOO.
 WE’LL KEEP THIS PARLOUR CLOSED.
 WHEN SHE’D SAID AS MUCH TO KAZ, HE’D SIMPLY REPLIED, “BUT IT HASN’T BEEN BUILT TO KEEP US OUT.
 YOU’D DO WELL TO REMEMBER IT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR SHARE OF THE HAUL.
 THEY WATCHED THE HARBOURS, TOO, AND IF A SIGNAL WENT UP FROM THE HARBOURMASTER OR A DOCKWORKER, THEY’D ALTER THE TIDES AND KEEP ANYONE FROM HEADING OUT TO SEA.
 THEY WOULD KEEP A MINIMAL CREW, ALL FORMER SAILORS WHO HAD MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE RANKS OF THE DREGS THROUGH ONE MISFORTUNE OR ANOTHER.
 KEEP THEM BACK AND DISTRACTED AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
 KAZ HAD BEEN RIGHT TO KEEP THEIR REAL POINT OF DEPARTURE A SECRET FROM THE OTHERS.
” WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SAYING THAT?
 “FIT HELVAR WITH SOME SHACKLES TO KEEP HIM HONEST,” HE SAID AS HE HEADED BELOW.
 THE GRISHA PRISONERS’ HANDS WERE KEPT TIGHTLY BOUND TO KEEP THEM FROM USING THEIR POWER.
 IT WAS BETTER IN THE FRESH AIR, WHERE HE COULD KEEP AN EYE ON THE HORIZON.
 HE HIRED THE BLACK TIPS AND THE RAZORGULLS TO KEEP US FROM GETTING OUT OF FIFTH HARBOUR.
 BUT IT HELPED TO KEEP INEJ ON THIS BOAT, IN THIS MOMENT.
 THOSE PRETTY PICTURES AREN’T GOING TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.
” “MEANING EVERYONE KNOWS YOU CAN’T KEEP AWAY FROM A FIGHT OR A WAGER, NO MATTER THE ODDS.
 IF YOU DON’T PROMISE TO TAKE IT EASY, I’LL SLOW YOUR HEART AND KEEP YOU IN A COMA UNTIL I CAN BE SURE YOU’VE RECOVERED FULLY.
 BUT IT WAS ENOUGH TO SEE THEM SAFE TO KETTERDAM AND TO KEEP THEM IN MODEST COMFORT FOR A GOOD WHILE.
 HE WAS GROUCHY AFTER SO MANY HOURS INDOORS WITH NOTHING BUT COINS AND CARDS TO KEEP HIM COMPANY.
 HE HANDED THE LOAN AGREEMENT TO JORDIE AND WARNED HIM TO KEEP IT SAFE.
 KEEP YOUR HEAD TILTED BACK.
” “WE’LL BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHECKPOINTS,” SAID MATTHIAS, UNABLE TO KEEP A HINT OF ADMIRATION FROM HIS VOICE.
 WHY DO I KEEP DOING THAT?
 SHE’D BEEN USING HER SICK MAGIC TO KEEP HIM WARM.
 “I CAN’T SWIM AND KEEP BOTH OF OUR HEARTS BEATING.
” “YOU CAN KEEP OUR BLOOD FLOWING.
 HE GLANCED ONCE AT HER TO MAKE SURE SHE WASN’T LOOKING THEN STRODE TO THE BLANKETS AND WRIGGLED IN BEHIND HER, STILL TRYING TO KEEP HIS DISTANCE.
 WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE HAD TRIED TO BUILD THE FIRE IN THE SHELTER OF A ROCK OUTCROPPING, BUT IT HADN’T BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP THE FLAMES FROM DYING OUT IN THE WIND.
 THERE WAS NO COFFEE TO BE HAD SO THEY ORDERED TEA AND LITTLE GLASSES OF CLEAR BRÄNNVIN THAT BURNED GOING DOWN BUT HELPED TO KEEP THEM WARM AS A WIND PICKED UP, STIRRING THE SILVERY RIBBONS TIED TO THE ASH BOUGHS LINING THE STREET BELOW.
 KAZ HAD TOLD HER TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR WOMEN USING SIMILARLY MADE MIRRORED COMPACTS AT THE CROW CLUB.
” “SO WHY DO YOUR EYES KEEP SEARCHING THE CROWD FOR HER?
 FOR ALL THEY KNOW, THIS IS A ROUTINE STOP, AND WE WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
” “JUST KEEP TALKING.
 THEY WERE IN ENEMY TERRITORY NOW, A PLACE OF STEEP RISK, THE KIND OF FIX YOU DIDN’T WALK OUT OF IF YOU DIDN’T KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU.
 JESPER WANTED TO PACE, BUT HE’D STAKED OUT THIS SPOT ON THE BENCH, AND HE INTENDED TO KEEP IT.
 WHAT MAKES A GOOD LITTLE MERCH BOY LEAVE HOME TO KEEP COMPANY WITH CRIMINALS?
 HORSES WERE A LUXURY, AN INDULGENCE TO SHOW THAT YOU HAD THE SPACE TO KEEP THEM AND THE WEALTH TO CARE FOR THEM.
 MAYBE HE’D MEANT TO KEEP SOME BIT OF INFORMATION FROM MATTHIAS.
 THE FJERDANS COULD CERTAINLY BE COUNTED ON TO KEEP THINGS ORDERLY.
 FOR SLEIGHT OF HAND, SHE REALISED, SO THAT HE CAN KEEP CONTACT WITH COINS OR CARDS OR FINESSE THE WORKINGS OF A LOCK.
 IT WAS AS IF ONCE KAZ HAD SEEN HER, HE’D UNDERSTOOD HOW TO KEEP SEEING HER.
 HE COULD KEEP TRACK OF THE DEAL FOR UP TO FIVE DECKS.
 JESPER COULD LEAVE THE ROPE FOR HIM, PRAY THE RAIN AND THE COOLING INCINERATOR WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP THE BOTTOM OF IT FROM BURNING AWAY.
 THE ROOF OF THE EMBASSY WAS CURVED, PROBABLY TO KEEP THE SNOW OFF, BUT IT WAS A BIT LIKE WALKING ON THE HUMPED BACK OF AN ENORMOUS WHALE.
” “NO, TO KEEP IT CLOSED.
 “HOW DOES SHE KEEP FROM COLLAPSING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THOSE DIAMONDS?
” INEJ STRUGGLED TO KEEP A STRAIGHT FACE.
 “LET’S KEEP MOVING.
 HE’D ENCOURAGED JESPER TO KEEP IT HIDDEN.
 JESPER WAS NO WRAITH, BUT IF HE COULD JUST MAKE THE DROP SILENTLY AND SNEAK UP BEHIND THE GUARD HE COULD KEEP THINGS QUIET.
 THE THOUGHT BROUGHT NINA LITTLE COMFORT, BUT SHE HAD TO KEEP MOVING.
 NINA COULDN’T TELL IF IT WAS NERVES, IMAGINATION, OR IF THE PLACE REALLY WAS COLD, BUT HER SKIN PUCKERED WITH GOOSEFLESH, AND SHE HAD TO FIGHT TO KEEP HER TEETH FROM CHATTERING.
 MAYBE MATTHIAS WAS LYING, OR ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT BLACK PROTOCOL IS A FAKE TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM EVEN TRYING TO OPEN THE GATES.
” “YOU KEEP HIM HERE WITH THE GRISHA?
 HE HAD TO KEEP GOING.
 IF YOU WANTED TO KILL A VINE, YOU DIDN’T JUST KEEP CUTTING IT BACK.
 SHE CLUNG TO THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING, FOLLOWING MATTHIAS, TRYING TO KEEP TO THE SHADOWS.
 HE’D HAD TO BRING THEM UP – ALONG WITH A POUCH OF CHLOROPELLETS AND AN EXTRA SET OF LOCKPICKS HE’D FORCED DOWN HIS GULLET IN CASE OF EMERGENCY – EVERY OTHER HOUR TO KEEP FROM DIGESTING THEM.
 ONCE KAZ WAS DONE, HE’D LET HIMSELF CHECK THE TREASURY PERIMETER, THE ROOF, THE ENTRY, BUT EVENTUALLY THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO BUT KEEP HIDDEN, STAY ALERT, AND WORRY ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE GOING WRONG.
 THE BALEEN ONLY PROVIDED ENOUGH AIR FOR TEN MINUTES, MAYBE TWELVE IF THEY COULD KEEP CALM, WHICH HE DOUBTED THEY WOULD.
 IF JESPER’S RIGHT ABOUT THIS GUN, THEN THE FJERDANS WOULD BE FOOLS TO KEEP THIS MUCH FIREPOWER JUST LYING AROUND.
” WHEN THEY ENTERED THE TOWN, MATTHIAS CALLED, “WYLAN, TELL JESPER TO KEEP TO THE WESTERN STREETS.
 HE COULDN’T HELP WHAT HE WAS, BUT DID HE WANT TO CULTIVATE HIS POWER OR KEEP HIDING IT?
 HE HAD THE DISTINCT SENSE THAT KAZ HAD TOLD ROTTY TO KEEP HIM UNDER WATCH.
 I WARNED YOU TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
 SOMEHOW I KEEP COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD.
 MARIE LU, AMIE KAUFMAN, ROBIN LAFEVERS, JESSICA BRODY, AND GRETCHEN MCNEIL KEEP ME LAUGHING AND PUT UP WITH SO MUCH WHINING.
 HE LAY IN BED AND TRIED TO PRAY, BUT ALL HE COULD THINK ABOUT WAS THE MAGICIAN’S COIN: THERE AND THEN GONE.
 STUFFED CABBAGE, POTATO DUMPLINGS, BLACKCURRANT CAKES, BLINI WITH LEMON ZEST.
 THERE IS MAGIC IN THESE PAGES.
” “OH, ANYA, WON’T YOU USE YOUR GRISHA MAGIC TO MAKE MY MOUSTACHE GROW?
 THE SAME MAGIC YOUR OWN BODY WORKS WHEN GIVEN TIME AND A BIT OF BANDAGE.
 THE MAN WHO FILLED DRINK ORDERS FROM BEHIND THE BAR WOULD LET HIM SIT UP ON THE COUNTER AND PRACTISE HIS MAGIC TRICKS, AND GAVE KAZ ALL THE HOT CHOCOLATE HE COULD DRINK.
 HE’D HAD OVER A WEEK ABOARD THE FEROLIND TO PREPARE, BUT HIS HEAD HAD BEEN FULL OF THE PATH HE’D CHOSEN, OF NINA, OF THE CRUEL MAGIC THAT HAD TAKEN HIM FROM HIS PRISON CELL AND PLACED HIM ON A BOAT SPEEDING NORTH BENEATH A LIMITLESS SKY, STILL BOUND NOT JUST BY SHACKLES BUT BY THE BURDEN OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO DO.
 BUT AT LEAST SHE HAD THOSE MAGIC SLIPPERS.
” “AND THE MAGIC TRICKS?
” “SOME PEOPLE SEE A MAGIC TRICK AND SAY, ‘IMPOSSIBLE!
 THE HARBOUR WIND HAD LIFTED HER DARK HAIR, AND FOR A MOMENT KAZ WAS A BOY AGAIN, SURE THAT THERE WAS MAGIC IN THIS WORLD.
 ANY GOOD HEIST REQUIRES TALENTED SPECIALISTS, AND I’VE BEEN AIDED BY THE BEST: STEVEN KLEIN OFFERED INVALUABLE EXPERTISE ON HOW BEGINNERS LEARN MAGIC AND POINTED ME TO THE WORK OF ERIC MEAD AND APOLLO ROBBINS, GENTLEMAN THIEF.
 HE’D ONCE SEEN HER MAKE EYES AT A PAIR OF SHOES SHE FANCIED IN A SHOP WINDOW.
 SHE DUCKED INSIDE, REFASTENED THE LATCH, AND PICKED HER WAY PAST THE EMPTY DESKS WITH THEIR NEAT STACKS OF ORDERS AND TALLIES.
 HE MADE A NEAT SLASH ACROSS OOMEN’S EYE – FROM BROW TO CHEEKBONE – AND BEFORE OOMEN COULD DRAW BREATH TO CRY OUT, HE MADE A SECOND CUT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, A NEARLY PERFECT X.
 HE ROLLED IT INTO A NEAT SPIRAL AND CLUTCHED IT IN HIS PALM.
 YOU SPEAK PEACE, BUT WHAT OF YOUR CHILDREN TO WHOM YOU MAY PASS ON THIS DEMONIC POWER?
 IT HAD BEEN A GUT DECISION TO PAY OFF HER INDENTURE WITH THE MENAGERIE, AND IT HAD COST THE DREGS SORELY.
 SHE WANTED TO PAY OFF HER DEBTS AND BE FREE OF KETTERDAM FOREVER, SO WHY SHOULD SHE CARE IF KAZ CHOSE PIM TO RUN THE GANG IN HIS ABSENCE?
 “KAZ CONVINCED PER HASKELL TO PAY OFF MY INDENTURE.
 ONE HAD BEEN SOLD BY HER OLDER BROTHER TO PAY OFF HIS GAMBLING DEBTS.
 TO PAY OFF HER DEBT?
 I ASKED PER HASKELL TO PAY OFF YOUR INDENTURE.
 HIS MOVEMENTS WERE RELUCTANT, AS WARY AS IF KAZ HAD TOLD HIM TO PET A RATTLER.
 HE SAW ANYA RISE AND PICK UP THE LITTLE BOY.
 “HE CAN PICK UP THE SLACK WHILE I’M GONE.
 AT THE LAST SECOND, MATTHIAS DROPPED INTO A CROUCH, KNOCKING THE FIRST WOLF INTO THE DIRT, THEN ROLLING RIGHT TO PICK UP THE BLOODIED KNIFE THE PREVIOUS COMBATANT HAD LEFT IN THE SAND.
 YOU CHOSE NOT TO PICK UP THE RIFLE.
 NINA TRANSLATED FOR MATTHIAS AS SHE TRIED TO TAKE IN WHAT THIS MEANT.
 I’M THE ONE WHO CAN NEVER WALK AWAY FROM A BAD HAND.
 THERE ARE TWO DREGS WAITING OUTSIDE HER DOOR RIGHT NOW, AND IF I DON’T WALK OUT OF HERE WHOLE AND FEELING RIGHTEOUS, THEY WILL SET THAT PLACE ALIGHT FROM FLOOR TO ROOFTOP.
 SHE WAS FAIRLY SURE THIS BOY WAS DEMENTED OR JUST HOPELESSLY DELUDED, BUT SHE LIKED THAT WORD, AND UNLESS SHE WAS MISTAKEN, HE WAS OFFERING TO LET HER WALK OUT OF THIS HOUSE TONIGHT.
 “THE EASIEST WAY TO STEAL A MAN’S WALLET IS TO TELL HIM YOU’RE GOING TO STEAL HIS WATCH.
 BUT A PROPER THIEF – LIKE MYSELF – NABS THE WALLET AND PUTS SOMETHING ELSE IN ITS PLACE.
 WHETHER IT WAS REAL OR JUST A CONVINCING IMITATION, A CHUNK OF YELLOW THAT BIG COULD BUY PLENTY ON THE STREETS OF THE BARREL.
” HE REACHED INTO HIS POCKET AND TOSSED THE LUMP OF YELLOW TO HER.
 IT WAS SOME KIND OF REPTILE, ITS THICK BODY COVERED IN GREY-GREEN SCALES, ITS HEAD WIDE AND FLAT, ITS YELLOW EYES SLITTED.
 AS THEY RACED PAST THE OPEN DOORS, HE GLIMPSED A PAIR OF YELLOW EYES GLARING AT HIM FROM THE SHADOWS, AND THEN HE WAS MOVING ON.
 YELLOW PROTOCOL?
” “THE ALARM WAS YELLOW PROTOCOL, A SECTOR DISTURBANCE.
” “BECAUSE OF YELLOW PROTOCOL?
 THE YELLOW LIGHT FROM THE DOME POOLED IN HER DARK EYES.
 “THE PRISON GATE IS ALREADY LOCKED UP TIGHT BECAUSE OF YELLOW PROTOCOL.
” “THE BIG, BROODING, YELLOW TULIP.
” “MAYBE YELLOW PROTOCOL IS WORKING IN OUR FAVOUR,” SAID WYLAN.
 MAYBE THE FOURTH GUARD HAD BEEN PULLED AWAY FOR YELLOW PROTOCOL.
